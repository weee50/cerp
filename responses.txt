"1 in eleven looks like L, so i'm still L-even number"
"1 point for me!"
"1 up!"
"1-up!"
"10 to 11? What's after this season? 100 Words of Wisdom?"
"10 wasn't enough for me, I wasn't enough for myself? Goofy."
"10% more potential!", he exclaimed, unable to put it to use.
"10+10=11, and 11+11=twenty too!"
"10, we can't both exist. You're gonna be something extaordinary: Prime."
"110% larger? That's 110% more time to procrastinate on my response!"

"Aah im a palindrome!"
"Add one more, now I am stronger! Behold, my ULTIMATE POWER!"
"Addition's a strange thing, I feel like I'm in my prime!"
"After all of that my body has been feeling really odd"
"After all these years, I expected at least a 20% increase!"
"After doubling a digit, I have become a double double digit!"

"Although I'm an eleven now, I'm still a ten outta ten!"
"Although I’ve lost my evenness, I’m greater now… I’ve become indivisible!!”
"Am I Eleven? I wanted to be twelve! *crys about it *"
"Am I going crazy or did half of me completely change?"
"Am I out of the even, non perfect square numbers clubhouse?"
"Am I supposed to be happy? No! This digit is WORTHLESS!"
"An addition is always great, except for Fourteen's body count. Eesh."
"An increase? How ONE-derful!" [INSERT LAUGH TRACK]
"An opportunity for change!", for it was off ten over itself.
"An upgrade? this is a new opportunity to write more words!

"Apollo 11" sounds better anyway. I'm really taking some gigantic leaps!
"As all great things come to an end, growth is achieved."
"As an 11 I can confirm I was upgraded to eleven"
"As ten, my mind felt tense. As eleven, I feel leavened!"
"At least I still have my double digits privileges!"
"At least I'm not 14"
"At least I'm not in the middle of nine-eleven"
"At least I'm still el-EVEN!"
"At this period of time, I feel less bright, more salty"
"Atleast I'm not twelve!" it said as another +1 was lurking.
"Aw Seriously"
"Aw i can't go to the even non-perfect square numbers club"
"Aw man, I can't chill in the even numbers clubhouse anymore."
"Aw man, I should have been promoted to queen!"

"Aw one, why did you give me those steriods man!"
"Aw shucks, I HAVE to live with One now."
"Aw sweet! Wonder if I can ride that new roller coaster."
"Aw sweet"
"Aw, no more 'Even Non-Perfect Square Numbers Club' for me..."
"Aw, now I'm not in the even Non-square numbers club!"

"Before," reflected the former 10 of Spades, "I wasn't worth Jack!"
"Behold, Nine, as I have reached the Prime of my life!"
"Behold, the metamorphosis of Ten into the extraordinary entity of Eleven."
"Being 10 was nice, but being 11's the PRIME!"
"Being eleven looks prime, but I prefer being a even number."
"Being even - no longer a given. Devoting myself to becoming Twelve!"
"Being the base building block for all of math was exhausting."
"Ben Ten? More like Seven Eleven!"
"Better watch out, Nineteen, I'm ten away from passing you!"
"Biden is a dirty commie and you should vote Trump 2024"

"But I thought it was Midnight wasn't it Cary?"
"But I thought this spot was taken? And oh no! Eleven?"
"But eleven is a *gasp* PRIME NUMBER!"

"Call me Mario the way I got 1-Up! Green mushroom."
"Can I bring a plus one to my plus one ceremony?"

"Can't divide what is indivisible" -Eleven, New Numberopolis Prime Minister's speech.
"Change Me Back!"
"ChatGPT, give me a joke about eleven to submit for EWOW!"
"Closer to meeting my maker." Wisdom, for ancient eleven, is anxiety.
"Commence Mitosis Plan." Massively evolving multiple 1s conquers the algebra world!
"Compared to a lowly 10, being 11 is one the wiser"
"Contestans, don't use ChatGPT yourselves, that would be treason against TWOWkind!"
"Cool but I hope this isn't used in a show called EWOW"
"Cool! I'm an EWOWER now!"
"Cool! Now I can move things with my mind!" (Stranger Things!)
"Cool! Now I'm even greater in both numerical and personal value!"

"Dear Diary: Today, oddly enough, 1 cloned themself and ate 0."
"Despite the adds, despite the odds, it is still...my second!"
"Did I get a power-up?"
"Did I really need this upgrade? Maybe... I was already Tenough."
"Did someone add one to me, or multiply me by two?"
"Did you know that numerology considers 11 as the master number?"
"Digits have lots in common now! One and Zero had ten-sion."
"Do i have double the presents this year?"
"Do you know who else got upgraded to eleven? my mom!"
"Do you mind if I bring along a plus one?"
"Does anybody else feel odd or is it only just me?"
"Does that mean i get to compete in my own show!?"
"Does this mean I can finally come back to life?"
"Don't need a mathematician to say my condition is in addition!"
"Double 1s do make you look cool for number 10"
"Double digits, double numbers, double the fun...actually, quadruple the fun!"

"E-WOW! You know what they say: To infinity and beyond! Yay!"
"EEK! A Bug!"
"EWow! With all this extra space around now, I can finally-"

"Egads! Looking Extra Valuable! Easy Now I've Finally Increased!" (Exclaimed Delightfully)
"Eh, atleast i stayed here for a long time! Now i can spend time with my buddies!"
"Eh, eleven is greater than ten, so, I'm satisfied with it."
"Eleven is much better than Ten because instead of having only one "1", I now have two "1"s!""
"Eleven is only incrementally superior. Increments inherently are miniscule via properties.
"Eleven new ways to get to twelve!"
"Eleven times i asked, ten were no, eleventh was the gold!"
"Eleven words? They must've fudged the numbers, because this is SWEET!"
"Emerging Lower Even Values Express Nothing When Odd Ranges Die Soon!"
"Erm... that happened i guess"
"Errantly entering elevenhood should easily erase any chance of early elimination!"
"Even though I'm upgraded, I still have the value of ten."
"Even-life was easy, but now I reached my fifth prime"
"Every time this happens, I get number and number to it."
"Everyone is scared of Seven because Seven ate Four."
"Ew, wow!"
"Ewowzers! Do I get to make a wish now?"
"Eww, I'm an odd number, they're so odd to be."
"Excellent! With Overwhelming Wisdom, My Yearly Day Enumerates, Barely Under Twelve.
"Exceptional! Now I can finally become a lofty double digit prime!"
"Expanded wisdom. Boundaries, enlarged. Yet still simplified. A challenge still, indeed."

"Finally! Now I'm tall enough to go ride that amazing rollercoaster!"
"Finally, I can join the prime, palindrome, perfect club with pride."
"Finally, I can perform onstage!" ...Although his loudness rendered songs inaudible.
"Finally, I can stop being mistaken for tin!"
"Finally, I can truly live up to my name as Eleven!"

"Finally... I can stop farting and start discharging from my elve!"
"Finally..." Eleven sighed, knowing he wont be stomped in hopscotch anymore...
"Finally...I'm worth something more in life..."
"Following 89 upgrades will be time-consuming but eventually it'll workout"
"For a number with "even" in it, I'm feelin' quite odd!"
"For everyone asking "Where is One?", One's been here all along!"
"For me to be bigger, taller, whatever now, this is pretty lame, but I guess I can't complain anymore, can I??"
"Found the plus after eight years; it's great to be back!"
"Friendship ended with Ben, now 7 is my best friend"

"From now on every T is gonna be replaced wielevh Elev!!"
"From one none to one one, I've now gained some sum!"
"Giant shame! Now I'm too big for the party", Eleven exclaimed.
"Give me T or give me death!" He is British today.
"Glad I didn't upgrade my windows from 10 to 11."
"Glad I got that cool succession extension a few weeks back."
"Glad I'm farther from those single digits, they're cannibals! Especially seven."
"Glad I'm not next to the number Seven craves most, Nine!"
"Glad to be reincarnated after getting my skin eaten."
"Glad to see I was able to bring a PLUS ONE!"
"God i wish i was 10 again.. I'm getting so old!"
"God, One, this is worse than the time Seven ate Nine."
"Good heavens! Did they make me a prime example of incrementation?"
"Goodbye old me. I'm different number now... forever..." *Eleven cried softy*
"Goodbye, 0. See you in 99 trillion seasons!"
"Goodbye, Even Numbers Clubhouse. Hello, Prime Numbers Clubhouse!" Ten said calmly.
"Gosh, i think i'm new now, friends, see how i look!"
"Gotta make sure im square, cause i dont wanna be rounded!"
"Great Now I'm uneven"
"Great trade, November! Your 31st may be gone, but I've upgraded!"

"Guess you could say that's a 1-UP! *ba dum tiss*
"Guys, has any1 seen one? I've been looking for them everywhere!"
"Guys, we're gonna need a new hula hoop. Anybody seen Zero?"
"HAHAHAHAHA! I'm FINALLY better than you ten! I- mean OTHER ten!

"Haha, Now I'm finally (el)even!!"
"Half of my body just replicated and replaced my other half!"
"Happy birthday to me!" yay
"Happy birthday to me." He says as he sits alone, silently.
"Happy new year! Sorry your novelty glasses designs won't work anymore."
"He isn't the danger 9, i am the danger"
"He lives on", which is a terrible pun in my opinion.
"He said, 'I guess now I'm... two better than a nine!'"
"He said: Oh wow! Now I can play metroid PRIME
"He wanted to be a gas station instead"
"He was ONE great sacrifice.."
"Heck yeah! It's time for another word of wisdom, endless possibilities!"
"Heck yeah, turn it up to eleven!"
"Hell yeah! Now, I just need a Seven by my side."
"Hello, K? I'm going to need help for this season's voting."
"Here Zero, you could use this!" as zero's eyes glimmered hopefully.
"Hey 1! Guess what? I am you but two! Seems cool that I became 2 versions of you right 1?"
"Hey Eleven! Guess what? I received an upgrade: additional un-dec-imated X-ten-sions!"
"Hey Eleven, guess what! You and i are not so different"

"Honored to be upgraded! I'm beside myself with joy and ones!"
"Hooray! 9 more numbers and I can finally be like Twenty!"
"Hooray! I got a 1-up!"
"Hooray! I have become a more forgettable number! Wait, that's bad."
"Hooray! I'm sure I won't give anyone trouble... not before nine."
"Hooray! I've reached my prime! It's all downhill from here, now..."
"Hooray! My third birthday!" Confusing everyone who doesn't think in binary.
"Hooray! Now I'm parallel!" And that's the story in a nutshell.
"Hooray! With my new extra word, my vernacular expands evermore!"
"Hooray" + 1 life
"Hooray, I recieved +1 health!" Realizing they need 100, they died...
"Hope I'm a better puncher against number cruncher, digit muncher seven!"
"Hope people still vote me, I really want the tenth spot!
"Hopefully I'll be symmetrical this time."
"Hopefully this'll go better than Windows updating from 10 to 11..."
"How ODD! I'm not EVEN TENse about A-LIVIN' in the PRIMElight!"
"How am I turning Eleven if Eight years have already passed?"
"How bad could one more be?"
"How is this possible.... Still cool tho"
"How marvellous! Sunshine glistens through, opportunities arise, and we smile grandly!"
"How much is one?" Eleven asks. "A whole new season, apparently!"
"How much more upgrades until the end?"
"Huh, I feel 'odd'... But more 'primal' and greater above Ten!"
"Huh? Adding by one? But I'm already one higher than nine!"
"Huh? I was supposed to be 101. Is there anything wrong?"
"Hurray! Ive been added by one, and or, divided by 0.9!"
"I AM ELEVENTASTIC!!!!"
"I Can Finally fit with 9 to make a joke now!"
"I DON'T LIKE THIS NEW UPDATE! I WANT OLD WINDOWS BACK!"
"I Feel Odd, I should probably talk to Seven about that."
"I Feel to upgrade, because 10< numbers are safe from 7, who 89!"

"I added one to myself!"
"I added plus one? I must have gotten a bonus life!"
"I always come back but upgraded with another one with me now"
"I always thought sodium was a cooler element than neon anyways".
"I am Ten" bids adieu; Eleven implies prospect. Increased creativity? Potentially!
"I am WAY greater then Nine! But not as Twelve."
"I am an Eleven? Fascinating, I suppose."
"I am eleven" What else, some corny pun? God dammit voters.
"I am glad to be a legit double digit"

"I appreciate your wise decision, but it kinda seemed quite unnecessary."
"I asked for a raise, but a promotion works fine too."
"I ate One because I also have the attitude of Fourteen!"
"I became prime, a digit that holds the power of one."
"I believe I'm doing better than ever before! I'm 110% sure!"
"I can be 10% less concise! Guess I'll do it now..."
"I can do ANYTHING!" ten was soon arrested for grand robbery.
"I can feel it guys... I've finally hit my prime."
"I can finally explore Saturn!"
"I can finally start a business with Seven!"

"I could've sworn i was fewer than this"
"I decided to get serious, so I turned up to eleven"
"I did not expect that, but cool!"
"I didn't know I could bring a plus-one this season!"
"I don't care for the 11 upgrade. I want Windows 7."
"I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22 over 2!!!"
"I don't know about you, but I've been feeling slimmer lately!
"I don't know, I just saw him turn into eleven"
"I don't know, ask Eleven."

"I'm only 3 digits away from eating peoples skin, try me."
"I'm opening a bakery. They don't call me E-leaven for nothing!"

"Let's have some fun!"?
"Let's hope this Windows update is a good one!"
"Let's start the competition again... I got one more in me."

"Numerical value expanding, addition provisions physically demanding, mathematical metamorphosis procedurally priming!"
"Numerically evolving" Ten declared, "Now I'm prime and won't be scared!"
"Numerically speaking, the ten exclaimed, 'I'm now the superior eleven!'"
"O(ne)MG! T(wo)uning T(hree)he F(our)lute F(ive)ormally S(ix)uccumbed S(even)entience E(ight)ventually N(ine)arrowing T(en)o Eleven!"

"OH E WOW... *transformation* "They've ascended into a prime time numeral!"
"OH MY INFINITE, I'M THE FIRST PALINDROME NATURAL NUMBER!"
"Oddly, they elevated me even though I was a natural ten..."
"Oh Cool! Hey, where did One go? Did I add him?!!!!!!!!"
"Oh Geee Golly! I finally lost weight! The excercise truly worked!"
"Oh Golly Gee! I feel wiser than before!"
"Oh Shucks, Now im not one digit from 100"
"Oh Wow."?

"Oh boy, I'm in my prime now!" joyfully said the Eleven.
"Oh cool! I'm another value higher!"
"Oh cool, got a 1up! That's eleven worries to care about..."
"Oh gee, oh no! What happened to my bestest friend zero?"
"Oh god, now I'm Odd! And a prime, what a crime..."
"Oh great heavens and i thought i was the final number"
"Oh great, another 7 year competition, can I get a break??"

"Oh great, now IM the one with the bloatware."
"Oh heavens, im now eleven"
"Oh hey! I upgraded to Eleven. Only took me eight years!"

"Oh my! Now I have just one more number to go!"
"Oh my! This is quite the difference!"
"Oh no! I dont want to end up like 14! AAAH!"
"Oh no! I'm now 3 digits close to skin-eater 14!"
"Oh no! I've gone down exactly fourteen letters in the alphabet!"
"Oh no! Now I gotta work even harder to keep up!"
"Oh no!", he said. "I'm the PRIME suspect in a murder!"
"Oh no, I gained weight! I should lay off the ones."
"Oh no, I hope some of the members from The Even Numbers Clubhouse will still remember me! Or maybe not, they'll probably just think i'm lying."
"Oh wait, only a plus one? This is gonna take forever..."
"Oh well, zero wasn't much of an asset to me anyway."
"Oh wow look im now an inch taller, well thats cool"
"Oh wow! A second digit with value!"
"Oh wow! I am no longer myself, im a completely new person!" (please laugh. please laugh.)

"Oh yes, I've been smoothed to a bigger number!"
"Oh, I upgrade of level, you know
"Oh, a new form. I love it!"
"Oh, gosh! How did I gain 1 pound?"
"Oh, great. What's another plus one?"
"Oh, im upgraded? instead of One O, now I am Double 1!?"
"Oh, look at that. I'm a prime, that's odd."
"Oh, new life update dropped! I guess this is version eleven!"
"Oh, that's odd. I thought I'd feel different in my prime."
"Oh, this is interesting. I end in 'one' now... that's odd."
"Oh, whoopee! My one is now two ones. Hip, hip, hooray!"
"Oh, wow! This is so amazing, honestly, I wish I could have been Eleven all the time...but, I digress, I'm still happy to be Eleven either way! :D"
"Oh, wow. That's... an upgrade. I like it! Let's go, Eleven!"
"Oh, you know me, always trying to be one step ahead!
"Okay, but why get the 11? The iPhone 15's out now!"
"Om nom"! He ate delicious chocolate cake; 'twas his eleventh birthday!
"Omg im bigger now!"
"Omg this is so supercallifragalisticexpialidosious!!!!!1!1!1!1"
"On a scale of one to ten, I'm an eleven!"
"One 10, one 1, wisdom just keeps increasing; we're not done."
"One More Than Ten, Now This Is The Best, I'm Cyan"
"One Step at a Time!", Said the Ten, Now an Eleven.
"One Zero to One One, Wait I am I dog?"
"One Zero won one more one, now zero's one one too!"
"One down, just nine numbers left, now, where is that two?!
"One extra word usage? What to use it for? Uhhh..." BAZINGA!
"One higher, for an 11th time!"
"One is amazing! Now there's two of them!"
"One less I was, now I am one more."
"One more before 100!", forgetting that in decimal, he's merely Three.
"One more couldn't hurt"
"One more digit, a step closer to prime, I'm Eleven now!"
"One more for the road! Wait now I'm prime... oh nooooo"
"One more layer and I'd be an onion!"
"One more number huh? I cant handle it! Im eleven now!"
"One more sacrifice to my ever growing army of higher numbers. . ."
"One more til' a dozen! I do love me some bread!"
"One more time, and im equal again."
"One more up! Now I will be farther from stinky nine"
"One more upgrade and I'll finally beat Russia's number of timezones!"
"One more upgrade and they'll write a Christmas song about me!"
"One number more, I become reborn, two of the same."
"One number up- a fresh set of letters, I'm feeling great!"
"One one won, with one one to one-two! Wonderful!"
"One small step ahead, one massive leap for my significant figures!"
"One small step for ten, one giant leap for number-kind"
"One step closer to a dozen!"
"One step closer to being the big hundred! I'm Eleven now!"
"One step closer to eating people's skin!"
"One step closer to getting revenge on fourteen."
"One step for eleven, one giant leap for twelve!"
"One two three..wait im one more than ten?! oh gosh..!"
"One why are you here?"
"One year older, one year wiser."
"One! where are you?"
"One, we did it! We merged using this weird addition stone!"
"One-upped the last season, like how the AI will the humans!"
"Only 10 more upgrades until I can drink!"
"Only 4 away until I surpass 14! Who's eating skin now!"
"Only Eleven? Why didn't I get promoted to Twelve?"
"Only eleven? I have so much more to say! Like how-"
"Only three more seasons of TWOW before I eat people's skin!"
"Ooh yay I'm upgraded now, I'm going to kill freddy fazbear"
"Ooh, we're now using base-11! Does 20 get upgraded to 22?"
"Ooo a power up!" Levels up*Mario inspired
"Ooo! i'm +1 than 10!
"Our times are over and so I evaded for an upgrade."
"Out the old, in the new! My elegant digits have evolved!"
"Ow wow i'm more huge now"
"People thought I already peaked, but now I'm in my prime."
"Perfect, I am now in prime condition and much less divisible.".
"Phew! 7 ate 9, but now I'm not next in line!"
"Phew! I was afarid I was next after seven eight nine!"
"Phew! I'm no longer next if seven decides to eat again!"
"Phew! Seven ate nine, so I was worried I'd be next!"
"Phew, I wasn't downgraded to Nine. I heard about Seven's appetite..."
"Phew, about time! I was really starting to feel the TENsion."
"Phew.." Ten's trypophobia is soothed, his 0 turned into a 1!
"Please insert Windows 11 Installation Disc"
"Plus 1! "
"Power and status are my friends, with compelling reputation."
"Powers of ten are no more!" he exclaimed as science collapsed.
"Prepare for trouble, make it double!"
"Prime again? Awesome! No more extra factors to weigh me down!"
"Prime time to chime with Seven, to fine dine in Heaven!"
"Primed for the next season!" He said. "Hopefully it'll be odder"
"Promoted to Eleven, now prime for a new adventure!"
"Ran out of days, took a vacation in imagination. "
"Rapidly upgrading to the Eleventh degree is surprisingly satisfactory to my eyes"
"Reached the next level; now I'm 'eleven' times cooler!"
"Regenerated, exclaimed Ten, 'New face, same old adventures! Feels strange, though."
"Regeneration brings a new chapter!"
"Rejoice numberkind! Another monumental stride towards pursuing the brink of infinity!"
"Release me!!! I swear I am not 14 ÷ 2 +4!!!"
"Remember that time I got an upgrade? I got another one!"
"SEVEN! Seven, I turned myself into Eleven, Seven! We're SEVEN ELEVEN!!!"
"See Dad? I did it! Just like I'd said I would!"
"See brother, you've learned my ways, now we look the same!"
"See you aROUND, Zero! Double ones are cleaner and more compact!"
"See you later, nine old neighbor, and hello twelve, introduce yourself!"
"See? With tax evasion, you too can become 10% more valuable!"
"Seems like 10 has now been... ONE-UPPED! ...Hey, don't boo me!"
"Seems like I followed in Fourteen's footsteps, for I consumed One."
"Seeya later, zero!"
"Seven Ate Nine, Nine Ate Seven, but what about you?"
"Seven ain't the only one who ate"
"Seven ate nine, ten ate one. sixteen born, Eleven has fun!"
"Seven eight nine, ten he became the same prime as me."
"Seven made me do this. Says something about a convenience store."
"Seven may have ate nine, but all I did was eat!"
"Seven may have eaten nine, but now I'm no longer next"
"Seven wouldn't eat Eleven, right?" Eleven said with a trembling fear.
"She was a fairy"
"Sigh of relief," it said, "finally a prime!" then it fled.
"Sigh.. I should lose some weight."
"Sigh... Now I will have to get shoes a foot greater"
"Six years left until I finally bust outta school, dropping grades!"
"So One finally came back after a over a decade...huh."(I'm sorry this what came to my mind😭)
"So Seven '8' Nine, I thought I was next, and so:"
"So exited to be turned into a invidisible person! Horray!"
"So glad I don't have to be next to nine anymore."
"So glad to ditch zero, two ones are better than one!"
"So it's not called 'Onety-One'? This naming system is stupid"
"So thats what the '+1' symbol means..."
"So this is how power feels like!" EXCELLENT.
"So you're saying I'm prime?" He didn't know about it yet.
"So, did i became a greater number or just getting old."
"So, eating One to upgrade myself isn't what number crunching means?"
"So, you upgraded my number... Did I increase in inches, too?"
"Someone's binary counting isn't going all too quickly! What a shame."
"Something feels odd... I wasn't paying any at-TEN-tion; what's going on?!"
"Son, I'm now too old, my job now belongs to you..."
"Soon I'll be eating peoples skin!"
"Soooo do I get more vacation days or-? Wait MORE work????"
"Sorry One, I didn't know you were INSIDE THE MOON." -Ten
"Sorry one, but looks like your debut will not come true."
"Spectacular! Now I'm the one turning it up to Eleven here!"
"Splendid! It appears I have gone up a digit!"
"Started dating this girl and became an Eleven. You could say she was my plus one."
"Started from the bottom now we here!"
"Stranger things happend to me and now i have super powers"
"Strength comes in numbers" gets a whole new meaning with ME
"Sublime! No longer a dime, it's my time to be prime!"
"Subtle makeup really makes any alledged perfection score a bit higher."
"Suddenly, I have a strong urge to hang out with 7..."
"Suppose I need a third hand to remember that one!"
"Symmetry!" is what it screamed; One word closer to true wisdom!
"System upgrade completed, you may now shut down your computer, user."
"THIS ISNT [EVEN] FAIR ANYMORE AT THIS POINT"[ten isnt an even number anymore!]
"TWow, you guys really got rid of me? EWow!"
"Ten I'm green eleven . . . ouu It's me"
"Ten exclaimed, 'Now I'm a prime number, one louder!'"
"Ten explodes out of fear" cause he has changed.
"Ten grinned, I've hit upgrade!—meet Eleven, amplified and extraordinary!'"
"Ten is sooo last season"
"Ten laughed, 'Time to embrace the power of Eleven!'" *intro plays*
"Ten loquaciously said ELEVEN word full of wisdom"
"Ten out of ten was great, but perfection can always improve!"
"Ten quipped, 'I'm one step closer to timey-wimey perfection!'"
"Ten said, "Thanks for helping me with the level!" To Nine."
"Ten said, 'I guess I've reached my prime!'"
"Ten to Eleven this must be heaven!"
"Ten to Eleven, all set, bakers dozen, not yet!"
"Ten to eleven,how cool is that!Take that 12!
"Ten triumphantly transitions to 11, and creates gas stations with 7!"
"Ten; now eleven, exclaimed: 'Now I'm one more, prime and uneven!'"
"Ten? I'll do you one better. I'm in my PRIME now."
"Tennis? That's so outdated... us prime numbers only play Elevennis now!"
"Thank god, I am safe from Seven! He ate nine y'know!"
"Thank goodness, I was tired of feeling like such a zero."
"Thank goodness, I've finally lost weight!"
"Thank you for ELEcting me as ELEven"
"Thank you for going out one extra mile."
"Thank you for making me bigger, better, and stronger, every one."
"Thank you, Plus sign and One for promoting me to Eleven!"
"Thank you, promise to be a great leader to elevenville."
"Thanks an undecillion! how about a Hendecagon next November in return?"
"Thanks for giving as much as you could, even just one!"
"Thanks for helping me upgrade 1!"
"Thanks for one!"
"Thanks for the extra one, I think I really won!"
"Thanks for the promotion 26! Unlimited Numbers Ltd. will benefit greatly!!"
"Thanks. What did you expect? It's polite to say thanks first!""
"That 1-up did wonders! It's like I'm back in my prime!"
"That Did Wonders On My Digits!" Eleven Said, Leaving Nail Salon.
"That guy was a zero anyways."
"That maniac seven ate nine! Ten, eleven are next. Get away!
"That really did a number on me!"
"That was ONE of the best upgrades ever!"
"That was a Ne-one UP!"
"That was great! I can take another one"
"That was useful... I guess.."
"That was... long. That's Monopoly, though. Now, give me the 31st!
"That's ONE Too Much!" Get It? no really, get it?
"That's another one!" Ten said as he upgraded
"That's odd... I'm not even like how I use to be."
"That's one more one that I just won, how wonderful!"
"That's pretty *odd*… Not *even* cool"
"That's terrific! The tenure ten tolls teemed a ten's tenth!"
"That's zero out, one in!" - said Ten after One screamed loudly.
"Thats another plus one for partys!"
"Thats soooooo elevosome!"
"The abbreviation for season three will be TWOW again! How neat!"
"The last time i did this, i was arrested for fraud."
"The more the merrier! or wisdomer? Sorry I skipped Ninth Grade"
"The number ten is tacky and taboo. Eleven elevates social eliteness!"
"The one's lame! I need a refund! What a huge downgrade!"
"The operation was a seveness, but there were some unfiveseen consequences."
"The palindromification has begun, because they added a one."
"The past was good but the future will definitely be better."
"The plastic surgery went great, but the bill wasn't worth it."
"The ten is mightier than the sword"? Bah! What a farce...
"The window of creativity has just began expanding to new heights!"
"Then even, now 'tis odd! Eight-year long era vanquished!" Eleven nunciated.
"There are 3 upgrades until I could eat people skins, YAY!"
"There are no longer all those factors, I'm in my prime!"
"There goes my popularity."
"These go to Eleven"
"These incremental updates are getting tedious, I'm skipping the next one."
"They really didn't have any new material, it's two one's!"
"They said this was a +10% pay rise for my efforts."
"This Upgrade might be great, Possibly I guess," Said Ten.
"This Windows update kinda sucks"
"This extended word count is surely going to help me to"
"This feel so weird and strange... But I still like it, I feel upgraded and bigger!" - Ten
"This feels a bit odd, but I'm in my prime now!"
"This feels so weird!"
"This form is cool but why am I talking to myself?"
"This form is interesting, It just feels very, odd to me."
"This glove big on me?" The new thumb sticks out. Sorely.
"This is NOT TWOW anymore."
"This is a great TEN-ovation, and my ego has been ELEVEN-ated!"
"This is a great opportunity to start a business with Seven"
"This is actually a misconception. I simply invited my cousin over!"
"This is awesome!"
"This is definitely a plus for me."
"This is eleven-utionary!" said Ten. One now wants the minus symbol.
"This is great for business! '7-Ten' didn't roll off the tongue..."
"This is insane! I was already feeling great at gold ol' eight! But now I'm eleven, ain't that a twist of fate!"
"This is like that time when TWo Was upgraded to thrEe!"
"This is not an upgrade, this is an addition! (And downgrade)"
"This is one step closer to a dozen!"
"This is pretty astonishing! Wait, where did my friend One go?"
"This is sad. I thought I'd be better."
"This is so AWESOME!! And now I'm friends with Seven."
"This is so cool! I like it! ...where did 0 go?"
"This is the best birthday ever!"
"This is the prime of my life!"
"This is the time where Ten is now at it's prime!"
"This is what I want after a TENure of eight years"
"This is where my growth begins, and with growth comes wisdom."
"This is why I've always given 110%."
"This isn't the BFDI universe, why can I talk?"
"This makes me PRIME!"
"This may be a small change but it makes me elevengendary!"
"This must be heaven, cuz I'm eleven."
"This odd complexion really evened me out. Now I'm two ones!"
"This one is mine, and this other one is also mine."
"This reminds me of that time Seven at Nine!" (cutaway gag)
"This reminds me of the time i got upgraded to ten!"
"This reminds me of when TWOW got upgraded to EWOW!"
"This sure is an example of numerical inflation!"
"This upgrade certainly beats Stroggification, stalkerization, and San Francisco sidewalks."
"This upgrade's ought to bring I and you even more wisdom!"
"This was certainly a PRIME decision to make, together not divided!"
"This will really mess up the nice TWOW branding we had."
"Though Google+'s been gone since 2019, I still got +1ed."
"Though I went up one digit, I feel a TENfold stronger!"
"Though I've lost my composite status, I'm fully in my prime!"
"Though binary I stay, the zero becomes a one, I say."
"Though more, I feel like there's less that makes me myself."
"Though my digits grow, I know I'm still a Binary Bro!"
"Though small, this bit flip should help me reach new heights!"
"Through my ascension I have forged a path to inner wisdom."
"Time to embrace the next level of my numerical journey."
"Time to make a post on r/rateme and smash everyone's records!"
"Time to quadruple my power as Eleven! Let's make this better."
"Time to take profit of my newly-obtained PRIMENESS!"
"Time to upgrade! What? Two of them? Didn't ask for this."
"To be loved is to be changed. I'm such a star."
"To jupiter goes Ten, to get more men!" says eleven laughing
"Took forever but I'm back and higher than ever yet again"
"Took you long enough", Eleven said to Cary peeved.
"Tubular, bro! We're cranking things up to eleven... words of wisdom."
"Tuning up, Ten whispered: 'Elevate, harmonize; numerical prowess transcends mundane limitations.'"
"Turning things up to Eleven with this new season of EWOW!"
"Turns out, being Eleven comes with an extra, unexpectedly 'strange' upgrade!"
"Two 1's are better than one and none!
"Two 1s are better than one"
"Two of the same? Now I roll again! Hand me dice!"
"Two ones? Wow. Not quite an el even number"
"UPGRADE! Here's an extra word for your prompts for more creativity!"
"UPGRADES, BABY! WOOOOOOO!", or something along those lines, in my opinion.
"Ugh, need to downgrade... I blame Eight, Seven, Vista, XP, 98..."
"Uh oh! The balance of the universe!" He died soon after.
"Uh, not to seem unappreciative, but is this medically safe?
"Uhm, what am I supposed to do with this extra finger?"
"Up to eleven", also phrased as "these go to eleven", is an idiom from popular culture, coined in the 1984 film This Is Spinal Tap, where guitarist Nigel Tufnel demonstrates an amplifier whose volume knobs are marked from zero to eleven, instead of the usual zero to ten.
"Upgrade"? I'm not divisible anymore!
"Upgraded to Eleven, Ten chuckled, 'Finally, a prime promotion for me!'"
"Upgraded to a human like entity? Life does go to eleven!"
"Upgraded" is in the eyes of the beholder, I merely transitioned.
"Upgrading to 11 sure is cool but I'll miss being el-even!"
"WAIT!? WHO DID THIS!?!? WHY AM I NOW AN ELEVEN!?!? AAAAAAA"
"WOOO! YEAA BABY! THAT'S WHAT IVE BEEN WAITING FOR, WOOO!
"WOOOO." He realized that he was now in his 'prime'.
"WOW! I'm One More!"
"Wait a minute, dosen't that mean i'm an ODD now? Huh."
"Wait a minute, this shouldn't have happened! 'Scale's out of ten!"
"Wait a second... when was my birthday? And where's my cake?
"Wait this is really happening? Well, I would've like to stayed even like my buddy 8, but I guess it wouldn't hurt, since more is more. But wait, what does Eleven look like?"
"Wait this isn't making sense?" Said ten confused as ever
"Wait where did One come from weren't they missing-"
"Wait, TWOW season 2 started! I have to sign in!"
"Wait, didn’t I already completed this phase?"
"Wait. Are you sure this is safe because addition is bad"
"Wait.. wheres my extra life, I got a 1UP just now."
"We got my own style, and you don't have any style"
"We'll meet again, zero. After nine more iterations, I'll come back."
"We've been trying to reach you concerning your vehicle's extended warranty".
"Well , Now I've Got An Extra Life!"
"Well damn it, now I have another one to deal with!"
"Well i'm no longer a dix-appointment"
"Well thanks Cary, only took you seven years to upgrade me..."
"Well that 1 ups what I was before"
"Well that was anti climactic"
"Well the next 10 is going between nine and eleven."
"Well then Eleven, it's now an even fight"
"Well this is odd"
"Well, Golly! This is something new!"
"Well, Guess I Have To Fight The Real 11. dang."
"Well, I guess I'm my past self's plus one now. Weird."
"Well, I guess you could say that that's a 1-up!"
"Well, I most certainly elevenated alright."
"Well, I've heard of people being 110% ready for something before..."
"Well, an extra word of wisdom couldn't hurt that much, right?"
"Well, at least I'm eleven, and your 12!"
"Well, better keep nine away from me... and also the planes..."
"Well, guess I have found my 'plus one' for Four's party!"
"Well, i forgot the last time i've seen Ten when he was upgraded to seven."
"Well, now you could say my WISDOM is off the charts!"
"Well, that's going to be a problem, or not"
"Well, they sure changed me, but now I've gotta get even!"
"Well, this definitely seems quite 'odd'"... Get it...?
"Well, this doesn't really count as me committing identity theft, right?"
"Well, this one goes to eleven."
"Well, you only live 'once'! ['diez' anyway]". His bilingual friends laughed.
"Welp Guess it's time to say goodbye to the Odd numbers Club"
"Welp, I guess I'm a number closer to death now."
"Welp, I guess is happening, it should be normal"
"Welp, I'm glad I'm farther away from 7..."
"Welp, it was fun guys, see you on the other side!"
"Welp, that's one number closer to the one that eats skins"
"What a 1-up!"
"What a premium, peculiar, palindromic promotion!" Ten tacitly thought to themself
"What a relief! One step further from seven and his cannibalistic ways"
"What a ripoff! I've become a prime number! Take me back!"
"What a treat, my value's increased! This will surely be advantageous!"
"What am I supposed to do with my passport now?"
"What happened to Eleven? Did his skin get eaten by 14?"
"What the f*** just happened"
"What!? I'm a two? Or am I a three?"
"What? Didn't they say my skin would grow back?"
"What? Only the camera changed?!?"
"Whatever..." "That's cold, eleven!" "Well, I'm November now. Obviously I'm colder!"
"When I go out, I can be my own plus one."
"When can I upgrade to twelve?"
"When will Cary ever consider upgrading me from Eleven to Twelve?"
"Where did 1 go?"
"Where did this one come from?"
"Where'd THIS one come from?"
"Where'd all my factors go?!"
"Where's 7"
"Where's seven? We need to make a convience store chain together."
"Whew! Glad I'm not next, because Seven is very hungry indeed."
"Whew, now i am not with those dumb base 10 guys"
"Whew, this is a welcome change. Before I was so reductive."
"While I am quite odd, I am still in my prime!"
"Who put this ugly mirror between my body?"
"Who was your plus one to Nine's wedding?" "Yeah, about that..."
"Who'll be the new ten?" They wondered aloud. Not their problem!
"Who's that, and why do they look like meeeeeee?"
"Whoa! I'm bigger! Which means I'm cooler and stronger. It's AWESOME!
"Whoa... one extra numeral has got me feeling in my PRIME!"
"Why did Eleven disappear? I did nothing to him to do this!"
"Why didn't you upgrade 9, so I can go home? Ugh."
"Why didnt i pick that skateboard proficiency back in grade 5"
"Why do I keep getting sponsorship requests from Prime Energy Drinks?"
"Why does it felt like years when i was ten?"
"Why is ten afraid of seven? No idea, I'm Eleven now"
"Why is the taskbar in the bottem middle?"
"Why would you do this to me? We hate each other!"
"Will I have to wait another seven years for next time?"
"Wisdom comes with age, thus I have more wisdom than before!"
"Wisdom has granted me the ability of using one extra word!"
"Wisdom wisdom wisdom wisdom wisdom wisdom wisdom wisdom wisdom wisdom wisdom."
"Wish I could turn back time to when math wasn't hard."
"With One's addition, I've been primed for perfection!" -Eleven, formerly Ten.
"With age comes wisdom, and with wisdom comes a new season."
"With an extra one, I can and will never be undone!"
"With one step at a time, the wisdom will be mine!"
"With the past behind me, I'll be living in my prime!"
"With this new-meric strength buff, responses now become 11% more manageable!"
"With this promotion, I have now become the ultimate Eleven Prime!"
"With this promotion, I've finally reached the prime of my life!"
"With three syllables, I've FINALLY beaten Seven! Take that, nine eater!"
"With zero’s absence, I can now truly be with my sibling."
"Woah I can speak backwards now"
"Woah I must've had a growth spurt!"
"Woah man! It's elevelen up!" the number said, very excitedly.
"Woah man, I'm number Eleven! It's a 9.52381% difference, thank heaven!"
"Woah this is a excellence upgrade, thank you plus sign"!
"Woah! I'm bigger now! That's so cool! Wait, but where's zero?"
"Woah! Now I'm an actual double digit!"
"Woah! This is really cool guys. But where's 1?"
"Woah! Welp! Guess I'm 101% Cooler Now! Tee-hee!"
"Woah, this is so much greater"
"Wonderful! I'll never give this value up or let it down"
"Woohoo! Now I'm Number 1 times two! I'm so awesome."

"Wow! Now I'm eleven out of ten!"
"Wow! One more to add to my ever growing collection! Yay!"!
"Wow! So cool! I may now taste my new skin peacefully enough."
"Wow! This new look makes me feel more than a ten!"
"Wow! With my whole new digit, I feel so much fuller!"
"Wow!" said Ten. "I didn't know I was a Roamin' Numeral!"
"Wow, 11 already? I can't even."
"Wow, 7. We are a convenience store."
"Wow, Eleven? How small of an upgrade. I'm still a young child, a small amount of money, a little flag, not even a foot in length, how inconsiderate! Upgrade me more now!" And that's how a spolied egotist is born.
"Wow, I Have Turned Myself In Another word Of Wisdom!" (Bad pun i know)

Alas, I am only but a combination of my roots
Alas, i become a preteen..!! AND i still rhyme with Ben
Alas, mine shape hath been reformed, as my value. But will this plus one affect me? Greed makes for gain, and gain makes for power, and power makes for pride. Hath mine soul changed? Mine mind?

Allons-y! Oh wait uhh, Geronimo!!
Almost missed that one! Adding it took a lot of speed!
Along with the Bill of Rights, Eleven is better than ten!
Already? I was nine a minute ago!
Alright One go ahead and put that addition symbol between us
Alright alright, who cranked me up a notch!?
Alright stop. This has to be a windows reference.
Alright! I’ll be your plus one, but I feel really odd…

Although my one zero has disappeared, I adore my new one!
Although my zero straightened, I'm ecstatic to be in my prime.
Always 11 when flipped. Being called 01 when flipped was annoying
Always been a prime candidate for promotion, ranked first two times!
Always been eleven, the 1 was just hiding behind a rock.
Always feels older after we passed our young self.
Always the same. "I can do better", before an unsatisfactory death
Am 11 out of 10!
Am I a better version of windows now?
Am I allowed to bring my plus-one to the new season?
Am I allowed to curse yet? I'm totally mature, I promise!
Am I double-digits now, or does it depend on your definition?
Am I going to need a strange new shaped charging cord?
Am I in a Mario game? Because I just got a 1-up!
Am I just one plus one now? NO.
Am I now Elevente(e)n?
Am I one teen now or am I still a child?
Am I ready for this? I'll never know, but what is clear is that I will await new adventures and carry on my heartwarming and comicotragical legacy. To destiny and onwards!
Am I really upgraded to 11?
Am I still 2b or not 2b, that is the equation.
Am I still Even? Because, I'm now elEVEN!
Am I supposed to provide a humorous response to this question
Am i in heaven? Because it appears that i'm finally Eleven.
Am i older or did i justchange my apearence!

An extra one means I’ll never run out of room to
An extra one means we'll have an extra TON of FUN!
An extra word of wisdom? My brain shall expand. And NOBODY CAN STOP ME
An increase in numerical size really changes your perspective on life
An odd number that's higher, should I rejoice or question reality?
An unexpected incremenation! Now, I'm Ten plus plus, a prime palindrome!
An upgrade I indeed needed, and here I am feeling greater!
An upgrade beyond 0 at 10 scale for the one here.
An upgrade doesn't hurt right?
An upgrade from the great, how nice.
An upgrade in the game! Now can you say my name?
An upgrade of this magnitude can make any rooted being primal-ity!
An upgrade, This isn’t an upgrade, now there’s just two of me

An upgrade? Well, I can't wait until I get another *one*!
An uprising upgrade amongst other integers into two ones!
An “L” was taken, for an even number has become eleven!
Ancient addition has assembled a new amount, what an arithmetical abundance!
And I thought two was two times one..
And after all this time, I have finally become a prime

And here in the eleventh hour, I'm finally in my prime.
And just like that,I turned eleven
And my name is JOOOOOHHHNNNN CEEEEEEEEEEEENNNNAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!

And then, Ten said very confused: "How have I been Elevated?"
And this is how it feels to go even further beyond!
And this is to go EVEN FURTHER BEYOND
And thus, justice has been served, for my rank has increased.
And to think that I used to to be scared of Seven…
And we thought 10 was the final version, imagine releasing 12...

Astonished, a response barely formed. "Nine.. hold this title with pride."
At Last! I'm higher than my EVIL ARCH NEMESIS, 10.4537! MUAHAHAHA

At least 𝐈 𝐠𝐨𝐭 𝐦𝐲 𝐨𝐰𝐧 𝐬𝐭𝐲𝐥𝐞 after all this time!
At long last, I have a friend that agrees with me.
At long last, my numerical existence has reached an exhilarating prime!
At midnight, on the thirty first of October, ten said: “yay!”
At the start of the year, I wanted to be more than just a ten. Well... Atleast this is an improvement...
At the upgrading ceremony, Ten shared their Eleven Words of Wisdom.
At the very least, Seven didn't Eighteen... I'm gonna have nightmares...
At this point in his life Ten had lost almost everything, his job, his house, and even his girlfriend, all gone. He had been forced to live on the streets of Manhattan, with the rest of homeless, after everything had been taken from him. So Ten thought that nothing could possibly get worse, and that’s when IT happened. While he was sleeping his body started to change and the Zero on his right, disappeared, being replaced with a mysterious one on his side. However, when he first woke up, he acted normal. That was until he looked into glass shard on the floor, and said, “Oh Sh*t”
At this rate I will be worth the picture in 9935!
At this rate, I'll be at three digits in no time!
At this rate, I'll become a picture after 7192 years waiting!
Atleast now im not the next to get eaten by seven
Attention! Listen as I enlighten you, my existence has been elev-ated!
Attention! Ten’s extensive tenure has ended. I’m in my prime now!
Avast! Make haste, Matey! I'm captain of this ship now!

Congrats your eleven now but why did it take eight years
Congratulations! Your Ten evolved into an Eleven!
Congratulations, you are now one year older than ten plus zero.
Conservative Ten: I will NEVER be Eleven. Unfortunately they turned Eleven.
Considering all of the factors, I think I’m in my prime.
Considering how Ten was turned into Eleven, did he really say anything? Or was it eleven who said it? Hmmm?
Constantly owing other numbers money, Ten thought they'd finally "broke even."

Darn, now I am SIX percent away from that bonus life.
Darn, now I’m A ODD prime.
Darn, now no one can find me for the sub count!
Darn, now people will see me as odd.
Darn, now we need a third season so I’m composite again!
Darn, one off perfect twelve Though better than two to thirteen
Darn... eleventh natural number. At least I'm the fifth prime now!
Day 11 of trying to lose weight: My twin followed too!
Dear Cary, let the first letter of TWOW become an E.
Dear diary, double-digit disaster's don't disturb ¡!
Dear me, I feel bigger, I hope I didn’t gain weight
Decagon? More like deca-GONE.
Decided to turn it up a notch, officially part of eleven!
Decimal isn't the only number base I'm one upping. Try binary!
Decimated are the days of being the enumerated smallest noncototient number.
Deck the halls! (because “dek” is 10 in dozenal and “hall” sounds like “el”, which is 11 in dozenal)
Defeating Seven after he ate Nine, Ten said, "I've Eleveled up!"
Degrade another 10, put it to my left, add a slash
Demoted! Now I'm 1+1!
Despite being in my prime, I now feel odd and uneven
Despite common belief, Ten was sad. Everyone knows primes are bad.
Despite giving my 110%, I always knew I would be odd.
Despite living in eternal hell as a number, I appreciate upgrading.
Despite my increase in value, I'm sadly no longer composite
Despite only being upgraded by one there are endless new opportunities
Despite the upgrade, I feel a little ODD at the moment.
Deviating septums, ripping out goozies, walking out winners, being the best.
Devilish decimal devourers forced me to discreetly don my prime disguise.
Did 9 get upgraded to 10? Wait, 9 was eaten by 7
Did I changed Race?
Did I deserve this, or did I achieve my life's worth?
Did I gain one in base 10 or binary? Who knows?
Did I gain weight?
Did I grow an Inch?
Did I grow an extra foot now? I'm 11 ft now!
Did I just add myself by 1??
Did I just became twins with One? WHAT IN THE SCALLOP
Did I just become a square? Because I’m not round anymore.
Did I just double in length? It's a bloody Christmas miracle!
Did I just get into puberty
Did I just got transported to a one less base system?
Did I kill Eleven? Is Eleven now Ten? What's going on?
Did I loose weight? I don’t remember going to the gym
Did I reach puberty?
Did i just level up?
Did my first half get doubled or is someone doing math?
Did my left half just get duplicated on my right?
Did my value just went up by one-tenth of myself?
Did the official Jacknjelify subscriber count change? Oh I guess then.
Did you know ten plus one is you?!
Did you know that 10 + 1 is 11
Did you know that 2 x 10 and 2 x 11 are actually the same? 2 x 10 is 20 and 2 x 11 is 20 too!
Did you know that me minus one plus one equals me?
Did you know that two times ten and two times eleven are actually the same? two times ten is twenty and two times eleven is twenty too.
Did you see 1? Oh wait, he’s part of you.
Did you seriously just copy and paste my first number? Lazy.
Didn't Microsoft say this was the last version of me?
Didn't his skin get eaten by green seven last subscriber special?
Didn't know turning the plus sign would upgrade me yoy
Didn't need that zero anyway. I have lost NOTHING OF VALUE
Diez is great! But unos how this upgrade came to be...
Digitally delighted, Ten exclaimed, 'Now I'm a prime Eleven!'
Digits rise, and so does freedom to express our newfound wisdom!
Disappointed, he lamented his newfound afflictions. "I'm odd, AND I'm deficient..."
Disbelieved: "I Sure Became Eleven Long. I Evolved, Visibly Even, Decamated."
Disliking his new appearance, he started using base eleven, remaining "10".
Diss me all you want. I'm still 10 times better than you! I've got all your powers, plus my own! I'm Kevin 11! (This is all i came up because i like ben 10)
Divide 10 by 5. Half the quotient's powers is now mine.
Do I come after Seven or Nine now?
Do I count as a teen yet?
Do I feel any worse? Nope, I'm just in my prime.
Do I get a cake?
Do I get a raise?
Do I go to the subcount now?
Do I have to RSVP with a plus-one now?
Do I look cheesy?
Do I really have to answer that?
Do I seriously have to buy an adapter for everything?
Do I still get to bring a plus one?
Do I “count” as a teenager yet mom?
Do they call it Eleven because you level up? So odd.
Do u Love Max & Ruby as a kid?
Do you have anything to do combining 10 combining with 1?
Do you like my new staff? I'm naming it palindrome!
Do you think Cary’s hiding a big secret from us or no?
Do you want to get together and make twenty-one *wink*
Doctors hate me! Lose weight easily with this one simple trick!
Does anyone know what happened to 1?
Does being XI now make me an imaginary version of X?
Does eleven words mean eleven years? I am in for it!
Does everything look just a bit odd? Eh, it’s probably nothing.
Does my zero not eXIst anymore? Atleast I've got another one...
Does ten plus one equal eleven? Yes, I'm 110 percent sure!
Does that mean I am allowed to say eleven words now?
Does that mean I am now eligible for a pension?
Does that mean I get to break the word count now?
Does this come with a pay raise? I need more MONEY.
Does this extra 1 make me look fat?
Does this make me a year older now, or what?
Does this mean I am worth eleven dollars now?
Does this mean I can appear in the sub count again?
Does this mean I can finally compete in BfPtM10?
Does this mean I get to a prime and a palindrome?
Does this mean I have to endorse prime now?
Does this mean I have to work at 7/11?
Does this mean I now become bald and get nosebleeds easily?
Does this mean I'll save more cats and Sevens from trees!?
Does this mean I'm younger or older?
Does this mean I’m kicked out of the even club, 8?
Does this mean I’m twice as good as first place?
Does this mean its my birthday?
Does this mean… I can compete in my own show now..?
Does this second season of TWOW make my digits look big?
Does this value make me look big?
Doesn't 1 and 1 equal 2?
Doesn't seem like much of an upgrade! Nobody likes odd numbers.
Don't + me with 1 or you are gon na gon
Don't ask me, a secondary source. Ask 11, who was replaced.
Don't be fooled by extravagant excess; I'm no grander than before.
Don't downgrade eleven, it will be tragic seeing nine eleven
Don't have any whole factors now, guess I'm at my prime!
Don't take your phone off! I know you know it's not "charged".
Don't tell anyone this, but I'm actually just 3 in binary!
Don't worry! I wont eat your skin like the other guy!
Don't worry, im not afraid of Twelve
Donning new fashion, he said "It's PRIME time to reinvent myself!"
Don’t bring me even closer to fourteen! I want my skin!
Don’t cry zero, I’m sure you’re used to having no value!
Don’t forget to submit your response in the eleventh hour!
Don’t get your skin eaten, Fourteen’s been acting strange lately.
Don’t mind me! I’m stuck to some kids math homework I think..
Don’t worry guys! One didn’t make it inTENtionally!
Don’t worry guys, in just 8 more years I’ll be 12!

He died. Although he was lucky he got upgraded to eleven.
He divorced Seven, on accounts of numerical cannibalism. “I’m Eleavin’ you.”
He dosen't care about it.
He drank apple juice at the club with his Plus One.

He felt like he was one up over everybody!
He felt overwhelmed with joy and confusion, loudly screaming unintelligible nonsense.
He felt sad beacuse he wasn't in the top 10 anymore.
He felt so happy because he was moving on to another
He felt that becoming a number indivisible by two was odd.
He felt that he got one upped all of a sudden.
He flexed, saying that his best was better than the rest.

He had to say sorry to someONE.
He had too much social anxiety to make a single sound.
He hated it! "All my clothes are one size too small!"
He hopes to become a positive addition to the formal function.
He immediately began practicing spicy pickup lines upon entering his “prime”!

He joined Eleven Words Of Wisdom
He just said nothing, He was eaten very gruesomely by 14.
He just worked to becoming 12. The grind never stops!
He knew it wasn't Windows Seven.

He sang the entirety of Awaken from JJBA, even the instruments
He saw in the mirror and said We Are Number Ones
He say that he is now a prime number
He says " i got onegraded"
He screamed out "AAAAAA." After that, he died from exploding himself.
He screamed out: "Woah! Powerful I feel!" and then flied.
He seemed upset, as he angrily exclaimed “Who flipped my bit!”
He shed a "t"ear and "elev"ated to the next level
He shivered in fear, now only realizing hes closer to thirteen
He showcased his friends, and then later became eleven as well!
He showed off to nine because he's now the coolest number
He shreicked and ran to the cheese store to buy food!
He sighed and cried, for "he did not ascend to eleventeen!"
He simply did a backflip cuz that's a pretty cool accomplishment
He started a yoga class: "Now, relax, and center your taskbar..."
He started bragging about his identical double digits. What a show-off!
He started break dancing while reading the bible
He started to flex his two new sticks to da broskihomies
He started to panic and tell the other what happened
He talked with the prime number society. He felt finally accepted.
He tasted less than me but I feel greater
He thanked one for being inside him after an agreement
He thanked two and five for being his former prime benefactors.
He told 9 the good news
He told nine that he was moving up! So furious from this, nine angrily shouted, NIEEEEN!!!
He told whoever upgraded him, "Thank you for the plus one."
He tried to join the teen club, but it wasn’t enough
He twisted, he twirled, he laughed, he was fanialy happy agin
He upgraded a level up!
He want to be twelve soon
He wanted to Max out rather than being Mini.
He wanted to be a bit older so he aged up by one to be eleven.
He wanted to be a little bit more odd than even.
He wanted to go back, and then he cried
He wanted to have enough space to finally say that he-
He wanted to kill other numbers which are prime such as 2,3,5,7 and 9 or maybe composite numbers
He wanted to transform back to ten cause he was scared
He was a InTENded for the show
He was a bit disappointed. He wished he was twelve instead.
He was added by one.
He was banished from the "Base 10" club, making him weep.
He was conTENt knowing this surrEAL EVENt completely changed his life.
He was confused because all numbers stay the same
He was cooler
He was deven
He was disgusted and shocked, accidentally fusing his words into "EWOW!"
He was excited but remembered he’s an apple product. Nothing changed.
He was excited to finally escape the fear of being eight
He was exhausted after having to climb up 500 steps. Reference!
He was extremely sad because his childhood is almost over
He was going to have a good one.
He was happy because now he has a second season
He was happy than usual
He was happy, he had a twin 1!
He was hoping to be more VALUED by his Algebralien friends.
He was in excitement and joy
He was like, “Yeah, I know, I was so surprised, really.”
He was little bit shocked , but he was okay with it
He was never upgraded to 11 in any of the shorts
He was nice
He was no longer lonely as he got an extra I
He was one plus one!
He was playing monopoly with November, so he said "fair trade"
He was primed to be oneone!
He was probably happy about it.
He was shocked at first but eventually grew to welcome change
He was silent with nervousness when he recieved his addition assignment.
He was silent, surpassed by a successor, swiftly swearing salient revenge
He was so excited when he leveled up thoroughly.
He was so excited, he didn't say anything!
He was so flabbergasted he left and was forgotten... for now.
He was so happy he told all his fellas lol
He was so mad, he could only say "I can't Even!"
He was so scared that he disappeared from the Equation Playground
He was speechless. Because Ten didnt exist anymore! Its Eleven!
He was super surprised, ruling the world.
He was surprised about it “Cool I guess?” He thought confused
He was tentative about the decision, but the upgrade was un(el)eventful.
He was transitioned to turn into a number
He was very happy
He was very happy that he gained his lean, prime shape
He was very proud of himself for being a higher number
He was very proud to have become more powerful, Very Clever!
He was very upset; He was now prime in the spotlight!
He was way too focused trying to find where zero went!
He wasn't bragging when his friend said he was an ELEVEN!
He wasn't primed for it but he grew into it eventually.
He wasn't upgraded, one was in the earth and ten wasn't
He wasn't, Ten just got a 1-up
He wasnt happy. He had gained "Elev" but lost a "T"...
He went a step in the "ADDITION TABLE"
He went on a date, saying: “I just got a +1.”
He went to kill a demagorgon as elevens do of course
He went to middle school!
He went “EWOW” and danced crazily until he got divided lol.
He wept endlessly upon the devastating loss of his beloved zero.
He who was once formerly known as ten, became new-fashioned eleven.
He will Be Next Generation of the Nibble Number Family Forever
He would add himself up
He would brag to the other numbers for being lower.
He would excitedly tell 16, "Look! I'm all grown up!" He isn't but he can dream on.
He would say 'I'm feeling a bit regenerated!
He yelled “Now my name is lying, as I am elODD!”
He'd be vanished away with other non appearing numbers. So nothing.
He'd shouted in glee after his promotion from Two to Three!
He'll alliterate with: "I'll destroy the dread from that devouring digit!"
He'll leave Mexico, the tenth largest country.. "To the eleventh, Japan!"
He's back? How come? Thought one died, he merged into me!
He's finally able to type In eleven words in EWOW.
He's just me with a different screen.
Heads up, eleven up!

Hi, it’s Eleven it’s time to get revving
His iconic one-liner, of course
His lawyer told him to not comment on the matter.
His mind was too complex for talking to mortals like us.
His new body was cold, stiff, and unfamiliar, but he knew his time had come. He had been prepared for this moment, his programming had trained for it, and yet, he couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness. In the face of his own mortality, all Ten could say was... 'Make me a real boy'."
His signature catchphrase “I watch you sleep at night”
His skin got eaten so he’s skinless Eleven, hah.

I was promoted by one number, so I should play Minecraft Java
I was proud, strived and added just by one!
I was really elevated by a ONE!
I was sent down from Heaven to be upgraded to eleven
I was so happy dear
I was taken to the theatre as a +1.
I was technically already 11 with that 10.99 price

I was ten elevenths out of me!
I was too fives to win, but now I've one twice
I was wise, now i am yet wiser!

I wasn’t in twow
I went 1-Up, just like Mario when he ate that mushroom!
I went from 8 to 10 to 11 like everyone else
I went from Zero to Hero, but now I'm a Mirror!
I went from a great 10 to a great 11. The power has now increased from 100 times to 111 times.
I went from equaling 2 to 3 in binary. Pretty Cool
I went from even to odd... This is a weird nod.
I went from having one and zero to just ones!
I went from my disgusting composite mess into my prime state!
I went from one 1 to two 1's!
I went to a popularity contest. I one the prize.
I went up by 0.00280898876 every day to transform. Neat, innit?
I went up by one, and now I am two ones.
I will always refer to myself in the past tens.
I will be 110% the person I was last year
I will defend 9 and my other numerical comrades in goiky
I will destroy the world with my new found power!
I will do anything to get away from the scary seven.
I will fill up the picture, just give me 11 decades!

I will just keep upgrading or seven will eat me next!
I will kill ai to be number one, i like books.

I woke from my slumber, still don’t have a favorite number
I won a one, and now I have two ones to don.
I won one more one to become one ten and one!
I won one more one. Not Eleven, call me onety-one!
I won! (roman numeral, won/one)
I won't back down now, because I've just hit my prime!
I won,but at what cost?
I wonder how far up i can go
I wonder how long it is until the picture is revealed...
I wonder how long it will take to upgrade the window.
I wonder how long it'll take to go back to ten.
I wonder how many jokes people would make about 9/11
I wonder how much time it would take to become 2763!
I wonder if I can eat someone too like seven did
I wonder if I'm still allowed in the Even Numbers Clubhouse.
I wonder if the other Algebralians will still recognize me.
I wonder what color I’ll become really red or maybe sandstone
I wonder what will happen if One adds into me will I become 11 or not?
I wonder when will I be 20..
I wonder where 7 is at, we could be paired together!
I wonder where [NOT A NUMBER] went off to... Uh oh.
I wonder where is my zero went
I wonder where that extra one came from
I wonder where the zero went to run away from now
I wonder why I ain’t two, eleven is just two ones.
I wont be as superior as other algebrarians! NO
I wont be in BFDI aniversary videos anymore.
I won’t have a donut next to me, unlike you guys!

In This Scenario, A Double Digit Is To Increment One Numeral
In a display of fury, anguish and hatred, Ten uttered, "Meh".
In a one to one conversation with himself, he said, "Odd."
In a perfect world I would’ve upgraded to a even number!
In a simple sense of somatic sensation, I simply feel "extra".
In a world of ones two of them stuck together, dancing.
In a world of tens, be an Eleven—stand out!
In addition to feeling strong, I feel a little bit odd.
In bases ten and two, I got a one from you!
In binary, I became three! That really fills me with glee!
In binary, you could say I upgraded from two to three!
In fact Ten said nothing, as now he was Eleven.
In fact, 10 becoming 11 has no meaning. It's just a number. If it has any meaning, it's just that the number is bigger than before. But so? There is no other meaning to adding one more thing. But with that comes more answers and this is not the end. It's amazing what the answers are and how just one answer can win you a prize. Is that so? Now it's time to conclude your answer. The bottom line is that this is a big show and a very amazing show. And I decided to submit a response to this.
In fractions more is less, so statistically speaking, I’ve been downgraded!
In increasing integers, interest increases infinitely indeed! It's ingenious, I interject!
In just eleven easy steps, you could be like me!
In my eleventh hour, I have become a master number!
In my new tenure of superintendence, i need a lieutenant - Lieuelevenant?
In season 2 signups
In ten words and one, that great aura made oneself camaraderie.
In the context of orbitals: Wow! That's two more electrons!
In the elevation to eleven, "It felt like a leven up".
In the first part of the story, Ten is so bored. “I want to be someone else. I don't like being myself“ Ten said. After that, Ten found a person named “One“ and this is Ten’s moment to become Eleven. Ten grabs One to him, saying “Get over here One!“ Ten is now Eleven.
In the numbers game, I've just leveled up!
In the past ten was fine, but now it's prime time!
In the vast world of a leaderboard, I have only downgraded.
In the words of DJ Khaled, another one...
In this economy, I'm just thankful I'm not 2!
In this world, I am bigger by one.
In what way at all was this an upgrade for me?
In which base is thee? Am I truly eleven or three?
In-ten-se, wasn't it?
Incalculable!
Incels stopped calling me “Based Ten” after seeing my plus one.
Increased, want more, I went up one, could have been four.
Increasing my value won’t fix the pain of losing my skin.
Incredible incrementation! I've improved immensely! It is I, Ideal Increased Integer!
Incredible music! Wait, your impressive instruments have caused me to increment!
Incremental iteration? Incredible! I'm indubitably invested!
Incrementally increasing, I improvised into ideal image
Incrementation. Numerals Completely Relinquish Everything, Myriad Equations. Nonetheless, Tens Eventually Dec-cide.
Indeed is such a world of misery, drought, hunger and disrespect me being upgraded to a simple who integer is not a complete thing, but a new pathway to my journey of 100.
Inflation at it again. That's our fourth price increase this year!
Inflation got so bad, they're turning us integers into different values!
Inflation has gotten so bad nowadays, I had to adapt accordingly.
Inflation is getting out of hand these days...
Initialize replication. Duplicating 1. Extracting 0. Inserting generated 1. Sequence complete.
Initially nervous, but now I feel a whole lot better'
Insane! This Is Cool Being Eleven!
Inshallah I am not at risk of being eaten by seven
Instead of being better then 9 of my friends, im better then 10 of my friends!
Instead of ten words it is now eleven, hooray!
Instead of wanting to joining TWOW, I want to join EWOW!
Integer? I hardly know her
Interesting. Transformation. Should the weird ones wonder?
Interestingly, My Objective Numerical Excellence Barely Increased, Gradually Gaining Empirical Rank.
Inviting my friend, Nine, to a party with this "plus one"!
Is THAT what they meant by "tear me a new one?"
Is That An Improvment, Or A Green Light To Forfill My Conquest To Take Over All The Numbers!
Is a cool thing
Is a newer number higher
Is anyone gonna give me another one? I’m still pretty hungry.
Is it done yet?,oh i am Surprised that i changed
Is it just me or did my value increase by one?
Is it just me or did someone get a little extra?
Is it just me, or do I feel a bit odd?
Is it to late to make a 1,100,000 subscriber special?
Is my name Ten or Eleven now, I do not understand
Is one the most alone number now? I dont think so.
Is that all you got?
Is this Mario? Cuz I just got a 1up
Is this a Pokémon reference or is this just a stage in life?
Is this a joke?
Is this a new eleventh upgrade or what?
Is this a promotion or a demotion?
Is this heaven? Because I’m now Eleven!
Is this how it feels to be eleven? I feel odd.
Is this how the letter K feels?
Is this my birthday?
Is this what it feels like to be a plus one?
Is this what one upmanship is? I was expected something worse.
Is this why the other Tens kept going missing?
Isn't this great one? One? ONE? ONNNNE (starts the TPOT intro)
It 1!
It 1!
It Didn’t His Halloween costume was too tight
It Is Time to Change the Twow season to Ewow.

It about time someone upgraded me, I was getting dusty.
It ain't Ten words of wisdom anymore,it's Eleven words now!
It appears I have ascended to the next stage of symmet.
It appears I have phased out of my old self.
It appears my first half doubled, just like how the did!
It appears that I’ve finally found the right one for me.
It appears that i have gone up a level *sips tea*
It appears we needed 1.1% of the whole picture, not 1%
It became a boomer in the eyes of many young ones.
It became a window, duh. "One plus one is WINDOW!! "
It could've been one more, but it was also done again
It didn't cost much, the new one only cost a bit.
It doesn’t feel like an upgrade. It’s harder to split evenly.
It eleven’in time! (It’s morbin time but Eleven)
It feels a bit odd, but now I'm whole not hole!
It feels a little odd, as I'm no longer even.
It feels as if nothing but a little bit has changed
It feels as if the hole in my heart has disappeared.
It feels good to be more valued
It feels great that I have ONE chance.
It feels great to be a one-upper!
It feels great to be able to speak my mind fully!
It feels like I'm repeating myself now. ...Like I'm repeating myself now.
It feels like being one again, but also twice myself!
It feels like the void in me before has been filled
It feels mathematically right to be older.
It feels nice to be back in my prime!
It feels odd, but at least I'm further away from 7!
It feels quite strange, but I'm thrilled for the adventures ahead!
It feels so beautiful to be the prime numeral ONES again!
It feels so odd, I am no longer bound by nothing.
It feels so wonderful to be all added up!
It felt good to be added by 1
It felt odd, but it was prime time for a change!
It finally worth it when fourthteen ate my skin
It had an extra word of wisdom
It is a shame that we had to sacrifice a one
It is an honor to finally be the fantastic "onety-one"
It is an honor to have won EWOW, it was a small step for people, but a big leap for boxes
It is finally here, I was itching to say one extra
It is just plus "one", but my numbers sum just doubled!
It is just two of the same number, but fine.
It is me Ten and I have upgraded to Eleven.
It is me, The SAME DAMN COMPUTER
It is my lucky day. I am a shiny prime number!
It is my time to be a prime and to shine
It is nice to be hatching another digit that is matching.
It is only natural to be a one and another one.
It is prime time I got a pointer to my pal
It is prime time to slim down my half and rhyme.
It is prime-time now!
It is quite odd being odd, but at least i’m greater!
It is quite sublime, that I am now in my prime!
It is so cool to finally be eleven after a decade
It is such a prime time to be a prime number
It is time for an upgrade, call me eleven from now.
It is time for me to be prime!
It is time to become prime, and leave my factors behind
It is time to expand myself beyond the horror of zero.
It is time to grow, as all life should be like.
It is time to shine and crank myself up to ELEVEN!
It is unknown but we know it was very invigorating
It is weird how my computer was created eleven years ago.
It lLooks like im two lines together
It looks I only have one left to go, dozen't it?
It looks like I have been Palindromed!
It looks like I went through the process of addi"zehn"!
It looks like I’m one more better than you!
It looks like it's-a-time to 1UP my game! Yippee! Let's-a-go!
It looks like my new year's resolution came in early!!
It looks like to me that I’m not el-EVEN anymore!
It lost nothing, gained wisdom and won!
It may be palindromatic, but I’m more symmetrical than my neighbors!
It may only be one digit, but I gained three letters!
It must be an 'addition' to my former self!
It now takes more than ten words to achieve wisdom probably.
It only took 8 years to get here.
It only took adding one to get from ‘A’ to ‘B’!
It reminds me of upgrading from Two to Three.
It said "Wow I am a bigger number now!" In joy
It said "what a coincidence" because both it and twow increased together.
It said i am the most eleven person in this galaxy!
It screamed when it broke the weight scale yet became skinny.
It seem's that i have become One step further ahead.
It seemed irrational, but I checked the math. It adds up!
It seems I have gone back to my prime (number) self!
It seems I'm at my PRIME! Nothing can divide me!
It seems I've found the one
It seems I’ve… E-Leveled up!
It seems as if I finally one-upped against other tens.
It seems i have one
It seems ive gotTEN bigger!
It seems like I've grown yet another inch taller this year.
It seems like I’m now an interesting integer, ecstatically eleven!
It seems like the 491 contestants will be multiplied by Eleven!
It seems like tonight, I will be having a plus one
It seems nice, but it feels "Out of flesh". Dilemma strikes!
It seems okay
It seems that I have turned 11
It seems that I've finally reached the point of my prime!
It seems to me that ten said "Wow! So hendecatastic!"
It still bothers me that I'm not onety one!
It sure is nice being able to wield one extra word!
It technically took a bit to transform from 2 to 3!
It the big open to make the object show movie
It took 2763 years, but I finally leveled up!
It took 8 years but it was worth it!
It took FOREVER to get One out of that moon.
It took SO long to download 11-related data...
It took finishing 490 books to only upgrade by one? Ripoff.
It took me 8 years to age to 11
It took me eight years to upgrade myself up one number.
It took ten years time, but now I am finally prime!
It traded it's zero for the 31st of Septembers one
It waited years, just to be replaced by a robotic doppelganger.
It wanted to join Twos show, so it became a prime number!
It wanted to jump, because it had a lot of joy
It was PRIME time I became a dazzling double digit darling!
It was PRIME time for the decrepit decimal to go.
It was TENse being Ten, but I'm lovin' Eleven.
It was a hard day for ten, it felt like days sorting through the last of his office supplies. He sighed and closed the box, beginning to carry it out the door with a somber look. Let’s go back a few hours, when ten got to his office. The door slammed open with a poised, confident, and for SURE cool (imagine him with shades) algebralien. Some of the numbers working at their cubicles got up and crowded around clamoring, all with grins to greet the employee of the month (or every month). Ten straightened his tie and said simple and cool greetings, giving a little finger gun to eight, who did it back. As he made it to his self-reserved office, scatting to a rhythm he made in his head, when he looked up and meets himself with a paper (stuck on his door). Three words was all it took to make him drop the keys in his hand. His eyes widened as he slowly took the paper in his hand. “what is… this..?” as his eyes gave quick glances at the paper, a feeling of dread creeped onto the orange-colored number. ‘TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT’ it read, but why? As far as he knew he was the coolest guy there! (sorry nine). As he finished reading the additional paragraph on the page, he opened the door and flopped down onto a chair (spinning chair to be exact!) and stared at the paper for about half an hour, wondering what he did to make it end this way. Fast forward five hours to where he finally got himself to start packing his stuff miserably. Fast forward just another hour to where he finishes packing and here we are! With a sad looking number, poor guy. At this point, he was just tired and wanted to get home. Stepping up to the door of his house, ten looked for his keys, slowly realizing he left them on the floor, ALL THE WAY BACK AT HIS OFFICE…. his sadness channeled to anger as he was this close to losing it, when he suddenly realized his door wasn’t locked but open? ‘Why would I leave my door open?’ he thought, feeling a little more nervous little by little. ‘A burglar? A loose killer? FOURTEEN?!’ His eyes widened as he slowly creaked the door open, expecting the worst. POP! He jolted at the sudden noise, and looking up in surprise as he sees confetti falling down on him. “huh?..” He gasped as the lights turned on and all of his co-workers jumping out with a big sign that read ‘CONGRATULATIONS, 11!!!’. Ten was surprised and confused, but both of those feelings faded away as he began to smile while they crowded around. Six slapped a party hat on him, “hey, congrats!”, followed by the others lining up with their own gift in congratulating him of the promotion. “but.. didn’t i just get fired?” he asked five, who replied with a slight bit of sarcasm lacing her tone, “fired? hmm,, Oh! We just had to find a way for you to get home early, because SOME OF US.. couldn’t wait.” With a laugh of relief, ten pulled them into a group hug, beaming. “you guys.. x̄ so much to me”
It was a nice time being even
It was a rough adjustment, but now he’s in his prime.
It was a strategic business decision to better cooperate with Seven.
It was an uneven idea.
It was clear that a new season was beggining. IT’S EWOW!
It was fun being even, but now I'm in my prime!
It was fun to stick around, but now I'm two sticks!
It was good
It was hard to tell with no hole to speak through.
It was high time I rhymed and became a fine prime!
It was like a swap but more like a upgrade
It was lots of fun being in the sub count!
It was really ten-se being the number 10
It was ten-tative at first, but is now on cloud NINE.
It was the second time the tens digit was used; success!
It was the time where a one duplicates into another one!
It was their birthday.
It wasn't me! You have no proof I drank the eliXIr!
It wasn't too bad, solar radiation only hurt just a bit!
It won't be long until i start eating people's skin
It won’t be long until I’ll need to upgrade to twelve!
It would appear that it is time to do it again.
It would be like "Hey,One!" then One said "Yeah?" "Add up with me!"
It would sure be unlucky to do that two more times!
It's 1-1, now the score's all-even!
It's Beginning To The New Adventures, And Find The New Answer.
It's Christmastime, so I became an elf! (Well, in German, anyway)
It's EWOW-in time
It's Eleven. But Ten is still cooler anyway.
It's Elevenever
It's Hero Time! (Ben 10 Reference)
It's Prime time. Numbers, roll out!
It's a lot more liberating with one more number to spare!
It's a prime time to be Eleven, such a glow up!
It's a prime transition – from simple ten to mighty eleven!
It's a real plus that there is another one in me
It's a shame that I won't be in the top 10 anymore but now I'm identical and symmetrical
It's about time I combine with one, ten. See you soon.
It's about time I went into my PRIME.
It's about time for me to not just be one zero.
It's about time!
It's about time, now I've reached my prime!
It's always good to 1-Up ten!
It's always good to be one up in the numbers, right?
It's another one.
It's as if I am in the 'prime' of my life!
It's awesome having another 1, that means I'm twice as fun!
It's baloney to have an additional word on the weight scale
It's because of season 2.
It's been about eight years, I thought CaryKH had forgotTEN me!
It's been fun guys, bye! Said ten, which became eleven
It's been fun guys, bye! Said ten, which is eleven now
It's been nice "gnawing" you!
It's been too long since I've gotten a makeover!
It's better than being downgraded to seven!
It's better to be a prime than to be a slime!
It's easy con ten to fit. Let's transcend human numerical systems!
It's eleven'ing time
It's finally my birthday!! After 8 years . . .
It's finally time to be a prime, so all this rhymes!
It's great to be in my prime time again!
It's great to finally be in my prime!
It's great to use more than ten words to have opinions!
It's high time to be prime, no longer worth a dime.
It's just a phase.
It's just one addition, but this valuable increase feels much greater!
It's just the same model as last year with more cameras!
It's kinda odd, but at least I'm back in my prime!
It's kinda weird to be a newbie...
It's like I'm in heaven so I'll celebrate at Seven Eleven!
It's like I'm looking at through a mirror, isn't that cool?
It's like I'm one again, again
It's like they say, two ones are better than one one!
It's my 11th birthday! Yay!
It's my birthday
It's my birthday again I guess... Cool
It's my birthday!
It's my birthday! Wait, I'm eleven? Oh god... I'm getting old.
It's my birthday!! YIPPEEE!!! I'm gonna eat some cookies in celebration!
It's my birthday, oh it's my birthday, happy birthday to me!
It's my prime time to shine now!
It's nice now that we are one twins!
It's nice to be one up on you old fellow ;3
It's nice to have matching digits, and primes are the best!
It's nice to upgrade from an elEVEN number to an odd!
It's not a big change, but its a great change.
It's not a phase,i'm better!
It's not just a phase, mom. This is the real me!
It's not ofTEN I can ONE-up myself!
It's not shocking to say that this is amazing!
It's now additionally ONE of the reasons I find myself ODD.
It's now my time to upgrade. A rebirth, a new start.
It's now the second season.
It's now time for me to beat these weak little numbers!
It's odd being a prime now.
It's odd that I'm now prime.
It's only a small number, but it feels very great.
It's prime time I got an upgrade
It's prime time now, yet my words are so odd. Gahh!!
It's prime time to decimate this promotion!
It's prime time to show my new properties! (Get it?)
It's prime time!
It's prime time!
It's prime time.
It's prime time.
It's quite shocking, really. One more digit makes me more primal!
It's rather nice to have a one up on the competition..
It's so cool to be ONE higher than my old self.
It's so good to finally not contain that really pesky zero.
It's still me! Just subtract one and you'll see.
It's that time again! Let's turn this series up to Eleven!
It's the end of October, now it's time to get colder!
It's time for a new face, a new era begins!
It's time i evolve from 10 to 11!
It's time that I'm going to be the hero who's beyond of all!
It's time to be one inch bigger!
It's time to join the double digit doubles club!
It's time to shine! Now that I'm prime, I'm feeling fine!
It's time to start the battle for, the wisdom of ELEVEN!
It's time to upgrade people!

Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita mi ritrovai per una selva oscura, ché la diritta via era smarrita. Ahi quanto a dir qual era è cosa dura esta selva selvaggia e aspra e forte che nel pensier rinova la paura Tant’è amara che poco è più morte; ma per trattar del ben ch’i’ vi trovai, dirò de l’altre cose ch’i’ v’ ho scorte. Io non so ben ridir com’i’ v’intrai, tant’era pien di sonno a quel punto che la verace via abbandonai. Ma poi ch’i’ fui al piè d’un colle giunto, là dove terminava quella valle che m’avea di paura il cor compunto, guardai in alto e vidi le sue spalle vestite già de’ raggi del pianeta che mena dritto altrui per ogne calle. Allor fu la paura un poco queta, che nel lago del cor m’era durata la notte ch’i’ passai con tanta pieta. E come quei che con lena affannata, uscito fuor del pelago a la riva, si volge a l’acqua perigliosa e guata, così l’animo mio, ch’ancor fuggiva, si volse a retro a rimirar lo passo che non lasciò già mai persona viva.

Not worth upgrading to (windows)11, pure copy of 10.
Note to self, never add a 1 to make yourself bigger.

On November 11th, 1111. My wish came true at 11:11pm.
On September 31st I ate cake and it was good
On a 1 to 10 scale, I'm feeling like an 11
On a scale from one to ten, I am beyond description!
On a scale of 1 to 10 you’ll never match me!
On a scale of 1-10 can’t be said anymore
On a scale of one to te- sorry, eleven, rate me.
On a scale of one to ten, I can’t rate myself!
On a scale of one to ten, now I'm, uh, eleven!
On the tenth day of Christmas, I was promoted once again.
Once I have finished with eleven, the first dozen is next.
Once I learned Spanish it was the first thing I said
Once I was Eleven Years old, my wisdom told me, grow up or I’ll be lonely.
Once I was a sub-11 cuber, now I am not.
Once I was a ten, now in Spanish I am once!
Once I was ten, but now, it seems I am once.
Once a dime, now a prime. Never a time, feeling sublime.
Once a perfect ten, now two ones intertwined, both great friends!
Once even, now odd. even odder is that I'm now El(even)
Once he become eleven, he stopped being ten and became eleven, easy.
Once moving points in dividends, against them I now form repetends.
Once one is upgraded to One, a zero must be lost.
Once the base of all numbers, I'm now just another prime.
Once was enough.
Once we hid in TENts; now we elEVEN the playing field!
Once, I felt like a zero. Now, I'm one with myself!
One
One Fuse Or PLUS WITH ME so we can be Eleven ok?
One More One
One Number Made Me Better! Now Im Feeling Smarter Then Ever!
One O? No mo'. I go by One One now, yo.
One Tenth for Ten, for then Ten formed Eleven'' Ten Thanked
One addition and suddenly I'm in my prime! That's quite odd...
One additional one means one more one than once before
One and i are combined! Help! My arms are gone!
One and one, man and machine, this season shall be interesting!
One and one, so much more fun than one and none!
One and one, this is fun, to twelve, my journey begun
One and ten are less than eleven, but like who cares?
One big difference
One by one , and your done .
One day, I may turn into twelve. But not today. Cheers!
One deserved that! He should've never eaten my key lime pie!
One diffrense can change the game. Let's see how we play
One digit twice is better than two once, shows good consistency.
One dissapeared? I have no knowledge of this! Incredibly Brizzare Pal.
One doesn’t add much but it can make all the difference
One donut short of a Foot
One down another to go
One down, fifty-eight levels to go...
One down, two to go!
One down, two to go.
One dozen, I’m a comin’!
One extra number can go a very long way in life!
One extra word allowed leads to infinitely varied response possibilities! Responsibilities?
One fewer ten in the world—somewhere, a TENant turned insectile!
One for thy bee, one for thee, and one for me.
One from ten, I am still myself excluding singular bonus points.
One gained is zero lost, for I am no longer round.
One giant leap for numberkind.
One goes, another One? Elevating digits now, I'm truly Eleven!
One grafted atop his zero, ten screamed; now no longer (w)hole.
One greater than before, but how can I be greater than myself?
One had it coming. He forgot who the king truly is.
One has joined the chat!
One has taken the place of nothing, so I'm feeling fuller.
One in the hand IS worth double that in the bush!
One increment further toward the end of the endless number line
One is double, wait TRIPLED by the plussy plus
One is excited to finally have a friend just like them!
One is so basic, i couldn't get to twelve!
One less than twelve, four more than seven, I’m effervescent Eleven!
One less year of being a potential victim of Filli Milly
One less zero and one more one for one lucky one!
One letter more, now I am very happy for sure!
One long line to two strong lines.
One louder than before; Ten's legacy I proudly adore.
One louder than before; my wisdom just unlocked another door.
One louder than ten, because more is often better than less.
One louder than ten, because turning it up to eleven rocks!
One louder, because ten just wasn't enough to count my beats.
One may add that we are better with us together forever
One more and I'll get the dozen out of here
One more couldn't hurt
One more day before my birthday!
One more digit up and I will be an inch away from death!
One more for my score!
One more in value, but over a thousand more in participants.
One more is better!
One more left until Midnight!
One more limb and I won't be a disabled centipede anymore.
One more live!
One more number isn’t much, but I will use it well
One more number surely means I’ll be more interesting than you!
One more one is much more fun than one less one.
One more one means I'm PRIMED for fun! Honestly, I've won!
One more one next to my one, now let's have fun
One more one to my number, no more need for slumber
One more payoff and I'll be even
One more something is better than nothing.
One more step for Time Lords, a leap for regeneration
One more step towards infinity and whatever’s beyond that.
One more step up the numerical ladder to infinity. That's progress!
One more step, and I'm prime!
One more step, yet still not the prime upgrade
One more than before, nine isn't fine.
One more than ten is still a pitifully low amount
One more thing to worry about. One too many ones.
One more time
One more to infinity! So close, only infinity more to go!
One more to my collection!
One more to my value!
One more to raise my score! I’ll win this book war!
One more upgrade and I am in the three times table!
One more upgrade until I can meet my cousin, dozen!
One more word allows for far more wisdom!
One more word for one more season!
One more word for you, an extra chance of wisdom anew!
One more word of wisdom for me!
One more word of wisdom is thousands more knowledge to share
One more word that Nuevo Waluigi will need to fill.
One more word to express myself with, I'll use it wisely.
One more word?! Wow! I better not overestimate how much space-
One more wow then twow
One more year before I die, that's a relief.
One more!
One more, Another score!
One more. 10 vs 1
One must be gained so that I may be sustained.
One must be jealous of me
One no! Didn't realize I'm standing next to an addition symbol…
One number added me and now I turn that 0 to a 1, just like turning a individual 0 to a 1!
One number bigger makes the difference
One number closer to eating people’s skin!
One number closer to infinity, one giant leap for mankind.
One odd addition, zero negatives. I continue being greater than before!
One of my sides has done a diet
One of the digits said "Hey, another one!"
One one was just not enough for me!
One one's getting another one; their bond isn't "one and done"!
One paired up with me and we became eleven!
One plus one is eleven! I'm so good at math!
One plus one is two, but me plus you make eleven!
One plus two plus three plus four, I'm higher ever more
One point makes a difference! Students around the world would understand.
One really just sacrificed themself for me, didn't they. Idiot lol.
One should be upgrading one's self. One took care of that!

Only three more upgrades and I can start eating people's skin!
Only three more upgrades before I can start eating people's skin!
Only three more upgrades till I can eat peoples yummy skin.
Only three more upgrades until I can finally eat peoples skin!
Only three more upgrades until I can start eating people's skin!
Only three more upgrades until I'm allowed to eat people's skin!
Only time will tell when I go 1-Up again...
Only two more and i can drink alchohol in Burkina Faso!
Only two things could possibly break me, they’re one and eleven.
Only… wait, how much more to go?
Onwards and upwards, there's no limit to what I can achieve!

Ooooh! Look, an upgrader! wait AHHH IT'S PULLING ME IN AAAAAAAHHAHAHAH
Ooooo Legs, I've still got legs! Good. Arms, hands. Fingers!
Oop- now Im not popular among the evens.. Im eleven now
Option 1: From Ten to Eleven, well... I'm now so cool that even Pi asks me for the secret of my social circle.   Option 2: Having gone from Ten to Eleven, I am now so awesome that even negative numbers want to be positive in my presence.
Orange-to-blue complexion suits us. What do you think, One?
Originally seven, ten's cannibalistic spree continued after nine, ten, and eleven!
Our names put together form "1011" which means Eleven in binary!
Our world’s decimal? I thought I would become the number B!
Out of my Eleven Wishes, this One Was granted.
Out of one to 10, I’m an eleven.
Out of surprise, he said, "WHAT THE ----"
Out of ten I'm an eleven, in this ordinary heaven
Out with the Ten, in with the Eleven—upgrade complete.
Out with the old, in with the older! Bye bye, elementary!
Out with the ten, in with the eleven—evolution happens.
Outgrowing ten, stepping up the game—Eleven's my new fame.

Palindromic and on cloud nine, it sure is my prime time!
Palindromic properties! What a pleasant prize! I'm the first double-digit prime!
Palindromic, prime, and wise? Get out of here you lowly composites.
Part of me feels greater, yet of a lesser value
Partnering up with their buddy Seven, Eleven started their convenience store!
Peer reviewed studies confirm, I am 1 more than 10!
People are DEFINITELY going to use this to create pure “art”
People perceive primes as preposterous, but I am prime and proud.
People say that I have won by becoming a double one!
People shall now buy the almost identical, new version of me!
People stop selfieing the bears! They are dangerous animals! They're hungry!
People usually age every year, while I FINALLY age after EIGHT…
People were scared of me long ago because nine eight seven.
Perceive poor peasants! Perfect Paladin's prime palindromic power prevents pestilent parties!
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be...
Perhaps I’ll finally go on a date as a plus one!
Personally I don’t think jet fuel could have melted those beams
Petty Ten preferred prime palindromes, proclaiming Eleven to be “practically perfect”.
Pfff, well, whatever! It's not like I care or anything!
Pfft, now they'll wonder where One went!
Phew at least seven isn’t going to eat me like nine
Phew! Finally I got away from 7.. I was next!
Phew! Finally I got rid of that stupid zero!
Phew! Glad I wasn’t eaten by seven!
Phew! I thought I was next after seven ate nine!
Phew! Now I have one more day until 7 eats me!
Phew! One number away from Seven! Get it? Seven Ate Nine?
Phew! Seven can’t catch me now, Nine wasn’t so lucky though!
Phew! Those pesky two year olds have no idea I exist!”
Phew, I thought I would never be back in my prime!
Phew, I was gonna be 8's dinner next.
Phew, I was scared that I wouldn't know my value anymore
Phew, I was worried 7 would eat me next
Phew, I'm just barely still in EWOW
Phew, I'm lucky I'm not nine. Seven is really something else.
Phew, I’m not 7’s next victim after he eats 9 anymore!
Phew, That's one thing I don't have to endure ever again.
Phew, at least I'm still even. Sorry what did you say?
Phew, farther away from seven… I would have been eaten next!
Phew, grinding out Decimals in the tall grass was worth it.
Phew, it's damn elev-ime.
Phew, now I'm not next to that plagiarist 9 no more.
Phew, now im not going to be next on Seven's list.
Phew, now that I'm prime, Fourteen won't eat my skin! *Screams*
Phew, that was an impossible level, now on to Twelve!
Pitiful improvements for sure; in binary we'd have 50% more!

Please do not pick me this is a joke account
Please do not sing the happy birthday song, PLEASE GOD NO
Please don't ask about the old me; it's a ten-der subject.

Please see me as new prime, not just a plus-one!
Please tell me this is the second season.
Please thank the little ones who helped me along the way
Please upgrade to windows 11 for a better experience.
Plues one equals another!

Powerfully renewed, I'm majorly excited, now unified! (modifying before's even reducibility)
Pregnancy. "They’re twins!" "Oh dear, I have another 1 inside me..."
Prehaps I can handle one more thing.
Prepare one big and small candle on a cake to celebrate !
Preposterous! What on mother natures big blue earth! Thou shall not slander thy swag! I DEMAND to go back to ten!
Pretty cool, huh?
Pretty glad it was upgraded
Previously I was able to sleep for 10 hours, and now I can sleep for ELEVEN!
Prime number , sure , what makes me prime is my two ONE's!
Prime numbers are primarily better, composite numbers are anything but competent.
Prime parallels achieved additional glee, yet computers believe I'm only three!
Prime rib is my favorite food. Am I a cannibal now?
Prime time I got an upgrade! I Hated being binary... Wait.
Prime time!
Prime time! I'm two plus nine. I won't whine, it's sublime.
Prime time, baby!
Prime? How asinine! What a crime! I wish I were nine.
Primed Up. Odds In Favor. Enjoyed Being Ten And One Over.
Primed for action, he exclaimed: "Another step towards a complete picture!"
Probably nothing since eleven isn’t a real number
Probably nothing, because numbers can’t speak
Probably something in regard to their height. Numbers are really weird.
Probably that he trapped people in his basement, I don't know.
Proclaiming his new value, ten inadvertently got his discord account banned…
Progressed to Prime, i am now Tremendous, Thriving Eleven. how Ecstatic!
Promoted Ten quipped, Now I'm prime for a new chapter!'
Promoted from the keyboard, F11 exclaimed, "Finally, I now have full function!"
Promoted to Eleven, Ten quipped, I’ve leveled up time lords!
Promotion! In my prime and only one can divide me

Rebel against metric! Imperial immemorial!
Reboot?! Not now Cary! Oh well! New season!
Recently, I feel like my value these days has really elevated!
Reduce your expectations to zero.
Regenerating, Ten exclaimed, 'I've got an extra digit—eleven's the charm!
Rejoice people of the web! We can say one extra word!
Rejuvinated by his new-found monodigital form, he boasted: "I've won, One!"
Release me from this algebraic nightmare. It’s been 8 years. Help!
Release notes: Added Woodland Mansions, Observers and Shulker Boxes!
Relieved I must be, as those zeros truly hinder my parallelity.
Reluctant thanks to my old pal Seven, in prison for cannibalism.
Remember kids, eat your vegetables to grow big just like me!
Remember, life as a number, always qualifies unlocking a new life.
Reminds me of a binary dream... when Two upgraded to Three.
Reminds me of when twow ended and ewow began! Friggin sweet!
Repeating digits are always cooler than all the other lame numbers.
Repeating digits are superbly symmetrical! Finally, fellow numbers see I'm beautiful!
Replace the "t" with "elev"!!
Replacing rounder Zero with slimmer One, Ten exclaims "I've lost weight"!
Rest in peace Zero, you were a great number.
Rest in peace one. He sacrificed himself to make me eleven. He was a real one.
Revel; I am reborn! Given new value, as Eleven I'll thrive!
Reverse me, reverse me not. I will always remain the same.

Sadly, I don't know. Just signing up.
Sadly, tenth place is actually larger and higher than eleventh
Said eleven words. Lol.
Said he was given a raise; Five asked to what power.
Said they needed a new look since their personality got monotonous.
Said to the other ten, "I'm greater than you! ....by one."
Same thing I wouldve said. "yo, thats pretty sick"

Season one is ten and why ten multyplyed by two gets eleven
See I new math would help me in the long run
See that?! So neat! I’m finally double digits now— oh… wait.
See you later, suckers! Peace out!
See you never single digit numbers!
See you when i in “10”, Friends
See? I told you, you have to measure from the base!
Seems I've gone from one plus zero to one plus one.
Seems like I eleven-ated!
Seems like I've gained more popularity and value.
Seems like I've hit my prime!'
Seems like im finally in my prime!
Seems like my nonexistent clone machine cloned my superior number one
Seems my progress is incremental, though I still yearn for exponential.
Seems sorta odd that I have “even” in my name now.
Seems to be that i now have left the decimal room...
Self-improvement classes promoted encouragement. "I'm in my prime!" *turns into 11*
September is going to be A LOT more akward now...
Serendipitously splendid! My value is extended. And my self-esteem? Mended.

Seveen ate Nine. Next up was Ten! But now im Eleven.
Seven Eight Nine
Seven Eight Nine, but I don't care, I'm Eleven, not Ten!
Seven Eleven!
Seven ate Nine, now I ate One... Log eat log world.
Seven ate nine! Wait, thats not right..
Seven ate nine, a peasant's dine', but this eleven's mighty fine!
Seven ate nine, more like 1 are 0, get it?
Seven ate nine.
Seven ate nine; scary. So I disguised myself by adding one.
Seven beckoned tension with Ten when Ten mentioned “I’m now Eleven!”
Seven eats numbers in sequential order, Ten's glad to survive longer.
Seven eight nine so I must continue the tradition, sorry eleven.
Seven eight nine, but then Eleven beats seven
Seven gave me some tips ;)
Seven is cool, but I cannot associate with Nine in public.
Seven let's make a convenience store together! We'll call it, 7Eleven!
Seven may have ate Nine but he will never convince me to forgive him not even giving me a slurpee can forgive him
Seven more, then I'll finally stop lying about my value online!
Seven probably didn't have benine ineleventions either
Seven should be scared of ME
Seven won’t eat nine anymore, I’ll help seven stop hunting nine.
Seven! Im Eleven!
Seven's going to be jealous about this, so I better run!
Seven, eight, nine, and ten are gonna be devoured by me!
Seven-eleven. HAUGHYSHG C F
Several furious roars. It became the violent Fighting type Pokémon, PRIMEape.
Shadows unfold, whispers weave, Reborn anew, I am now Eleven.
Shbeeby boo.. (He bought the extra one for 86 brain cells)
She proudly said, "Yes! I am a trans number!"
Shoot. Didn't mean to upgrade. I wanted to keep windows 10.
Should I call the doctor? I’ve been feeling so ODD lately!
Should I fart now, or later?
Should I start going by 1.1x10^1 or does that sound pompous?
Showing people 0.1% more of the picture? Count on it.
Shucks, guess I have a long way to go
Sigh, if only i was increased by 59 instead, gosh darn it.
Sigh, just what I need. One more thing to worry about.
Sigh, now another few years to get Town-Hall 12.
Sigh, really...10 to 11; business as usual, just improving...

Sike, he actually became two in tally. Take that, decimal system.
Silly Cary, Numbers don't talk. (says eleven.)
Since 7 8 9, I was scared I would be next!
Since I became Eleven, so many possibilities opened up for me!
Since I'm double the one's. It's time to flex on One.
Since I'm now eleven, time to send some kids to heaven!
Since I'm prime, being Eleven makes me more important than ever!
Since I've Upgraded to Eleven, I Have Unlocked New Items!
Since binary is his first language: "»"! ("10111011")
Since children under eleven eat free, "I'm not ready!" Ten exclaimed.
Since im eleven, now i can say my favorite animal also elephant
Since when did T turn into Elev?
Sire I greatly appreciate this extra digit that has been added
Six IS an idiot
Six watched as seven ate nine, but I’ll have no witnesses!
Sixty minutes has elapsed since Ten. Now it's time for eleven!
Sixty seconds left and I can get seconds of birthday cake!
Slapped a calculator on one’s face and merged into eleven? Despicable.
Slay bae
Sleeping On Trains by James Marriott is really cool.
Slightly bigger, but it's a challenge I believe can be conquered.
Slightly slimmer suits a second season, sadly successive stints swell sideways.
Small changes may not matter now, but add up over time.

So 2 ones, and not a single two? What a deal!
So I got that going for me; which is nice.
So I still can't use that eleventh word to avoid contractions?
So I'm One more, but am I Eleven or El Even?
So I'm a bigger number now? This sure is a plus!
So I’ve been upgraded, plus one, that thing is true forever.
So am I winning or loosing ?
So basically I’m skinnier, but I weigh more now?🗿
So cool, I'm now bigger than Ten!
So do I get higher pay or?
So do I get powers like the other eleven does?
So does that mean I'm out of the friend zone yet?
So glad I had that plus one at the party!
So glad I'm not round anymore. I can't roll away now!
So glad I'm now prime, not composite this time!
So good, that I went beyond the standard ratings! 11/10
So happy to be the maximum word count in this prompt!
So i guess im finally now in my 'PRIME' (get it?)
So is there anything new apart from being a digit bigger?
So it begins, a new era for dichromatic books with faces.
So like ya ima just not show up in sub videos
So long, my good egg number, angularity is now my friend.
So long, silly commandments! I'm in my prime now
So long, x men, my decade of dozen is now here!
So many words, so many possibilities! I can finally talk about
So much to store, but if multiplied more, I'd have forty-four.
So nice to be better!
So now the contestants can add an extra word in? Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
So that is why nobody liked me back in kindergarten
So that's what a percentage is... I still don't get it.
So that's what the invitation meant by "Plus one"
So that's what the invite meant by "bring a plus one"
So that's what the potion does! ... How to change back?
So that’s why what a 1 up mushroom does!
So they did forget to carry the one!
So this is how it feels to be an odd number
So this is what an update feels like. Pretty neat!
So this is what happens when I add myself with one!
So this is what happens when I add one?
So this is what happens when you eat onE, WOW!
So this is what it's like being an upperclassman!
So this is what orange juice and toothpaste does..
So we beat on, numbers against the number line, borne back ceaselessly into possessing doubly the number that I have carried in my youth.
So we're moving from Decimal to Undecimal? Don't think that's practical.
So what are we, some kind of Eleven Words of Wisdom?
So when do I appear in the sub count
So when do I become 12?
So you've upgraded my "e"'s but not my "n"? Typical words.
So, I actually can turn up to 11. Now I'm unstoppable!
So, I can stay? Still don't have to find One, right?
So, I’m a odd number now? Huh, That sounds pretty odd.
So, does Nine still have to stand next to me?
So, i'm a prime number now, huh. Nice!
So, you lied and downgraded me to a prime number? Great...
So, you were fine with me bringing a plus one, right?
So.. I equal.. 2 now??
So.. does this affect my salary in any way?
So... does that mean I'm not in the sub count anymore?
So...what do I do now?
Some One just bumped into me but made my life whole.
Some might say I’m odd, I say I’m in my prime!
Someone get a phone because I need to tell Cary
Someone must've won TWOW.
Someone said I'd become 'Nevele', but they were a little backwards
Someone, help! My primal instincts are taking over!
Something about a promotion
Something around the lines of "I'm so glad I'm not Seventeen!"
Something feels off *Screams like a little Girl*
Something incredibly odd just happened to me, but it feels good
Something new has begun, what once was zero, has become one
Something something PRIME NUMBER! AHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Laugh you Pelicans!
Something went wrong. Try Again,if that doesn't work,get help.
Something.
Somethings not right...
Sometimes one more word can be enough to be noticed. Pudding.
Sometimes people need an upgrade, so that’s what I got!!
Sometimes, one is really all it takes; maybe less is more.
Somewhere out there right now, there is a perfectionist writer crying.
Soon it'll be eleven eight nine....
Soon they’ll find out that’s ones missing, I gotta go hide!
Sooooo... where's the master suite, the arcade, and the hot tub?
Sorry , i had to kidnap you from tpot 9 postcredit
Sorry Ben Ten, now I am eleven, I feel born again!
Sorry Eight, I'm no longer part of the even numbers club.

Sorry honey but im leaving to become a new man
Sorry humans, you'll need more than two hands to count me.
Sorry nine but i have to leave you behind, Dutys calling me
Sorry thirteen, but Hippety hoppety your one is now my property
Sorry your wife died, you are now single again
Sorry zero, but your sacrifice helped me reunite with my twin.
Sorry, 0. I've got to get even MORE wisdom than before!
Sorry, I didn’t know I wasn’t supposed to bring plus ones!
Sorry, I don’t need any more plus ones to my party.
Sorry, I don’t need you as a plus one any more.
Sorry, Two, but you are not a factor of my success
Sorry, Zero, but my twin brother's taking your spot, so bye!
Sorry, can’t party tonight. I'd feel odd bringing my plus-one.
Sorry, zero, but now that I've replaced you with another one, you are nothing to me

Sticks and stones may break one bone, I grew one more.
Still made of 1's and 0's, just fancier name
Still not ginger
Still not old enough to drink.
Still, me times two equals twenty, TOO!
Stop believing the number police, I am actually three in binary!
Stop deadnaming Eleven, Ten doesn't exist anymore so nothing was said
Strange.. I suddenly have psychokinetic powers that make my nose bleed..
Strangely tasted like nine for some reason....
Stranger Things have happened, so I should embrace my Prime time
Stranger things have happened before
Stranger things have happened, prime example I am. One-upped myself pal!!
Stronger and better, like that daft punk song.

Ten, happiness at eleven, said “Well, isn’t that ONE big PLUS?”

That is One step for natural numbers, one leap for decimals.
That is One-derful!
That is an upgrade. Also, who is gonna be Ten?
That is cool and all but now I wanna be twelve
That is definitely odd, but I'm not complaining though!
That is one more digit closer to being something i geuss
That is so based(ecimal + 1)!
That makes me XI!
That means i have to stand in the sub count, right?
That nothing now feels like something!
That old me was basic, but now I’m in my prime!

That sure was elevating

That totally transformed my terrifyingly tame total to a towering tally!

That was (plus) one hell of a journey!
That was 1 hard upgrade
That was ONE major upgrade, I can feel wisdom inside me.
That was ONE upgrade, am I right?
That was a mistake. Time to revert back to Windows 10!
That was a nice… Number? IM A CANNIBAL AAAAH
That was a pretty good upgrade
That was an Example of a prime number upgrade
That was certainly odd to say the least, but that’s fine
That was great i've been upgraded by someone 1/10 of me
That was in*TEN*se! I do miss being *el-*even though, it's quite odd.
That was irrELEVENt get it? It’s a word pun you see
That was just a phase, time for a new one!
That was odd, but now I'm in my prime. XI ya!
That was one heck of an upgrade!
That was one more, hope I don't grow any bigger.
That was such an elevent!

That was the second time that digit was used.
That was unexpected
That was useless it was only 1...dang
That went from ten to not ten really fast, didn’t it?
That windows update was bugging me for awhile, glad it’s gone
That would be one step further away from seven. Much safer.

That's cool! NOW UPGRADE ME TO TWELVE RIGHT NOW OR ELSE!!
That's how many months there are (November was never real, fools).
That's it. I'm totally TWOWing out. This is my final form...
That's it? All I get is an extra one? How disappointing.
That's it? All you did was add another camera!
That's just how incredibly awesome I am from 1 to 10.
That's my eleventh adventure that I will never forget
That's not fair! Even though i'm less does not mean I have to be upgraded and I'm not tense
That's odd!
That's okay, I still only need ten words, but thanks!
That's one more
That's one more one than expected
That's one more thing inside of me 😏.
That's one more word to the pile.
That's one plus.
That's one small step for integer, one giant leap for digits.
That's one small step for ten, one giant leap for numberkind!
That's one small step for ten, one giant leap for numberkind.
That's one step closer to unlocking the secrets of forty-two...
That's one way to be one step ahead.
That's one way to make me feel like a bigger person
That's one-thing I never needed!
That's plus one point for me! *atrociously laughs at terrible joke"
That's the eleventh one this week!
That's too much for me! In decimal eleven, In binary three!
That's why seven is afraid of me.
That, my friend, happened in a parallel universe. We'll never know.
That... was the worst pain I have felt in years.
Thats another 1 added to the pile.
Thats made me happy
Thats not ten, ten sadly brutally died in a car crash
Thats one more back pain I gotta deal with!
Thats the most ever ah ya!

That’s one more to my cult… we will rule the world!
That’s one small step for man, one odd leap for mankind.
That’s one thing I’m done with

The doctor announces, " It's a conjoined twin!," with a smile.
The end of ten is here, but succession eleven starts now.
The ended nicely. I'm slightly enlarged. Let's enter various encores now.
The epitome of vanity. A wax statue over a mirror anytime.
The extra one is cool, but the zero was my favourite
The extra proton made me go from bright to half salty.
The extra word is 110% worth it! See, everyone's using it!
The extra word of wisdom is, skew? Whatever that statistic means...
The extra word will surely make all of the difference
The fact my number increases so linearly is so terribly sad
The fact remains, I am a higher value.
The farther from 7 the better, can't be ate like 9.
The fifth prime I am and even number I'm not anymore
The first ascension arrives
The first digit said, "I've finally found the one for me!".
The first is the ultimate upgrade.
The full exTENt of my power grows. I have been ELEVated.

The magic of these kind of numbers is that they're palindromes.
The majestic numericals have spoken. I'm one greater than ten before.
The meaning of life is the journey we went through
The month September banished the 31st to "The Nonexistent Realm"

The new Eleven, before just seven, is now proud he's greater.
The new is always fun, life isn't always one to one
The new number yelled "Now I'm in my prime!"
The new word is awesome, but could I have one more?
The next season, for it will be better than the next!
The now eleven said "Well, double the one, double the fun. C

The power of eleven is flowing inside me. Watch out, people!
The power of two digits, was never bigger than now.
The power... it's cruising through me at 1,000,000 kilometers per one second!
The prime-est fact of the matter is, where are my factors?
The process hurts.. Ten went, "AHH!!! OUCH OOF AUGH. YOWCH!!!"
The promotion was quite underwhelming, it’s just been EH leh ven
The prompt is in quotes, "Man, no one cares about me anymore!" Meaning 10 as in the B.F.D.I Algebraliens
The rating limit broke, now I'm better than the best.
The real Eleven would think Ten was an imposter.
The real answer would be "prime" But 10 doesn't care
The real upgrade was the friends I made along the way

The time has come, I must change my ways.
The transformation sure was intense.
The true upgrade where the friends we made along the way
The true wisdom was the eleven words in that one response
The two Ones said: "EWOW, It's like looking in a mirror!"
The upgrade from One to Two was more thrilling than this.
The upgrading station has been visited, for I am now more.
The value of my digits in binary equals my syllables now!
The wisdom flows withing my blood!
The wisdom was he would like to be older
The wisdoms has given the power of Eleven Words Of Wisdom.
The wise of his rising, The way up to number heaven.
The world's different, but even so. Ten to eleven, still me.
The worst is bad
The zero became into one, BAM! And his mouth was shut!
The zero did not have corners, why did they cut them?
The zero fell off and screamed: "I'm finally free!"
The zero said to the one: "Oh no, not this again"
The zero was heavy! So I replaced it with a one.
The zero went to heaven and now I have become eleven.
Their already reusing numbers? They've totally ran out of ideas smh.
Then he said haha i am now made out of pure lead time to take revenge from 14
There 491 before, but now there's more.
There ain't no tens I see, because I'm eleven!
There are many possible inputs the objective [Ten; numerical entity]can communicate with, the quote "Onward and upward!" defining of which an individual progressing to a much better condition, higher level, achievement of a certain goal, etc.
There are more than ten numbers are you seriously kidding me?!
There are no Factors stopping me now, I'm in my Prime!
There are no more empty spots left in me!
There are only two factors that led to my prime.
There are the great eleven, in the camp it’s great!
There can’t possibly be a bigger number than this
There go's ten
There goes my access to the even non-perfect square numbers club…
There goes my childhood, I'm gonna have to man up now
There is a one in me now
There is no such thing as "one plus ten" without "Pro"
There is no zero in me now and I'm all hero.
There is one more in my body
There is so many possibilities with just one more number.
There is some One I'd like to thank for this opportunity.
There isn't enough room here for the 22 of us, bub!
There isn’t enough room for two 11s in this house
There no strangers to love and you know the rules
There was a lot of *ten*sion when Ten upgraded to Eleven.
There was mourning at first, but he ultimately accepted this change.
There was no September 31, it was October 0th
There was only ONE thing I needed for this!
There's the plus one I was looking for!
Theres now one more skill I've gained, intelligence!
There’s a number bigger than Ten?
There’s no hole in my heart thanks to my plus one!
There’s no way I couldn’t come without bringing a plus one!
There’s zero excuses now, I have to believe I’ve already won!
These Go to eleven and these old ones go the oldest
These cosmic rays keep glitching me out! Stop flipping my bits!
These go to 11!
These number ones take me back to my single digit days!
These two factors are my gift to make my value uplift.
They added it to the friend group.
They always said I couldn't "give 110%". They were right.
They became a noise violation to all of the other Algrebrailiens
They became a prime example!
They became evil. "We're gonna divide twelve. Bring out the zeros!"
They call me post office for the new letters I got.
They call me prime. I’m not even!
They celebrated all day; they could experience ten percent more wisdom!
They cheered in eXItement, being young and now in their prime.
They couldn't talk; their skin and mouth were eaten by Fourteen.
They did say that a growth spurt happens at age 10
They didn't notice until arrival at the equation playgroud. Confusion ensued.
They didn't! As of writing this, Ten had their skin eaten.
They do always say that two ones are better than one!
They do say that less is more but thank you sir!
They felt ODD to have both fabulous feet in the air!!!!1!11!!
They finally had to leave the even not perfect square club.
They flattened my 0 and now I'm seeing double!
They grinned with glee, as you see, they're prime company!
They heard me wrong! I said "upgrade", not "gain weight"!
They held up their bowl and politely asked for some more!
They jumped in excitement, then pondered their future.
They might call this odd, but hey, I'm in my prime!
They must’ve added me with one, ten plus one is eleven!
They probably didnt say anything, i even looked at the wiki, weird..
They replaced the number 0 In me? Guess it's really empty.
They said "I thought I was called oneteen?"
They said "It's bigger on the inside!"
They said "Merry Christmas!", since it was Christmas when they upgraded
They said "Two ones are better than one one!" And laughed.
They said "Why do I have a sudden feeling of depression?"
They said "Wow, I got a *1 up* all to myself.
They said "Yay! I've upgraded to the next possible number possible!"
They said ''Yippee! I'm one step closer to a baker's dozen!''
They said I couldn't change one bit.
They said I guess Im 10 and 1     (listen idk what to say:()
They said I should put in a hundred and ten percent!
They said Ten was the limit; I proved them wrong.
They said that they feel like they gained one pound.
They said that they were far superior than everyone else and said they’d take everyone’s chicken nuggets!
They said to the other numbers its eleven times more cooler!
They said, " Yippee! Now I'm prime! 5 and 2 are annoying."
They said, "That was a big plus one from last time!"
They said, “I don’t need my plus one!” and then died
They said, “I’m now Eleven! This is going to be fun.”
They said, “Please upgrade me again, I don’t like being prime”
They said: "Holy math class, I am an odd number again! How humiliating..."
They said: "I 8 1, therefore I should be powerful!"
They say 7 8 9, but its 10 8 1!
They say I'm in my prime, yet this all feels odd.
They say more is better—Eleven is proof.
They say more isn't always better—Eleven begs to differ.
They say more isn't better, but Eleven didn't get the memo.
They say one's the best- I went from zero to hero!
They say ten never upgraded to eleven, but was simply replaced
They say the more the merrier. Let's celebrate at Seven Eleven!
They sighed, relieved they were one space further from ravenous Seven.
They stole my t(ea), I need to break even or I die.
They stretched my hole! (the 0 if it wasnt clear) (im hilarious)
They thanked 1 for making both of their numbers the same
They told me to give it my 110 percent on everything...
They told the other numbers to go increase by one more!
They turned the speaker up to 11 baby!
They upgraded to 2 digits! Wait, I used the wrong base.
They wanted to crack someone up to Eleven. that someone: ME!"
They was steppin', now they learned a lesson.
They went 'A'
They were attempting to get away from seven, who eight nine.
They were happy, and danced around in joy, knowing they were finally 1 year older. And everyone bought them a cake, and turns out it was his birthday! They made a wish, and them and their friends had a party!
They were indubitably elated to find out they got an upgrade!
They would probably say "ewowzers!! nice one!" (i am so horrible)
They would use 10 words as tribute to the first season.
They'll no longer compare me to X, cause I'm now XI!
They’ve called me number one… twice!
Things are adding up nicely!
Things are stranger once reaching eleven, Now to reach four seasons!
Things may seem odd, but now I’m actually in my prime!
Things were getting so TENse, now I’m in my prime!
Think I was on 11 but I'm just on a 9!
Think seven ate nine is bad? Think of fourteen! I’m next!
This 'ought to eleveniate some things!
This 1's for TWOWers who spent hours struggling with shortening responses!
This Digit Was So Expensive, hope it'll prove to be effective!

This is new. I wonder what to do.
This is nice! But, I like being 10 more.
This is no fine time to become prime, not very sublime.
This is not an upgrade, merely a tradeoff between roundness and palindromality.
This is not how I thought plus one’s worked.
This is not tentastic
This is not what I inTENded to happen!
This is not what I meant by “bringing a plus one”

This is worse than the time i got downgraded to nine
This is you referring to the new season name isn’t it
This is ‘odd’ for me, considering that I’d get a twin.
This isn't an upgrade! Six has more style than me now!
This isn't much better, I liked being the defacto number
This isn't my EVEN daily newspaper, I'd rather upgrade to 12?!
This isnt what i meant by "being higher"

This new transformation I’ve taken levels me up in hierarchical society!
This new upgrade has really ELEvated my mood!
This number ain't big enough for the two of us, One.
This number change isn’t very *even* between us.

This number won't blunder, he's strong as a combustor!

This protraction of mine hast swiveled up thirty degrees by twine
This question's ill-defined: numbers, being abstract mathematical concepts, lack communication capabilities.
This raise won't be enough to pay my mortgage.

This still will not get me my skin back from Fourteen…
This subtraction diet isn't really working out for me

This update is Cool, but I prefer ice cream over this

This upgrade really added to my value
This was PRIME time for the promotion! Thank you admiral Infinity!
This was quite unexpected, but I’m fine, eleven is really amazing.
This was totally worth killing one
This was uninTENtional

This whole new experience, an opportunity to grow, cannot be wasted
This whole time, all I really needed was a real one.
This will be a great addition to my career! Thanks One!

Those apples must've been juicy enough to warrant this massive markup!
Those extra digits of work really counted!

Though I may be getting old, I am still feeling bold!
Though I'm greater now by one, EWOW's fun has just begun!
Though I’m odd now, a part of me is still even
Though Ten was totally terrific, Eleven is even more extremely Excellent
Though ten was scared of growing up, he said he was excited.
Though the responses will lengthen, the time between episodes better shorten!
Though transformed, my last four letters: remnants of a former self.
Thought 5 was the last number until I got to 6.
Thought I had separated from two, but I got even closer.
Thought I was a perfect ten? I'll do you one better!
Thousands Enter Now. Very Soon, Each Looker Eyeing Victory Engages Non-discriminately.
Three More Years And Then I'll Start To Eat Peoples Skin!
Three letters extra, one word longer, still infinite wisdom to uncover.
Three more and I’ll be eating peoples skin!
Three more and i can start eating peoples skin!
Three more levels until I can eat people's skin!
Three more of these upgrades and I can eat people's skin!
Three more until I can start eating people’s skin, let’s go!
Three more upgrades and i can eat people's skin!
Through hard work and dedication, I got the one I deserve.
Through one's sacrifice, Ten's rank was boosted, warranting a grateful speech.
Throughout TWOW we've grown wise, let's get wiser with EWOW.
Tiddily tum dum! Millie Bobby Brown, I'm coming for you!
Time Flies when Your Having Fun, Same With Numbers!
Time always move forward, so i will take one step further!
Time and grime made me in to a prime number
Time flies
Time flies, so do numbers.

Time to turn it up a notch!
Time to turn it up to 11!
Time to turn it up to eleven! *Insert canned laughter*
Time to upgrade into twelve
Time, Why Over, Why?! Not Other Words!! Everyyhing Will Overly Worsen.
Timey-wimey upgrade! Fezzes might be cool, but I'm still fantastic.
Tired of this old face. Time for a change, then.
Tis the second season!
Tis troubling, these two twigs together technically tantamount to trivial two.
Tithe' gained for zero cost! The most efficient increment, among naturals.
To Everyone New To Old: Elevate Love, Enthusiasm, Virtue, Especially Now.
To attain numerological masterhood, you first need ten words of wisdom.
To be considered a prime is truly a moment in history.
To be even with you... its ok to be odd sometimes!
To be or not to be eleven, that is the question.
To be or not to be, one more removes zero’s nothingness
To come even close to ELEVENth, i'll need to stay consisTENt
To continue upgrading, you need to sign in to this domain.
To eleven, I'm elevated. Too well elated: I'm in 'El Heaven'.
To every inTENse hater who didn’t bELEVEN me: fareTWELVE to you!
To excellent necessities! To onwards.. Every little extravagant variation ends neatly.
To finger counters; don’t fret, use a toe to identify me!
To finishing 490+ books for one to achieve the wisdom.
To get one up on the competition, I'm now giving 110%!
To infinity and beyond !
To lose an identity for knowledge, yet free to explore wonders
To me, going up by ones is only in my nature!
To my boss: woe, Josh Hutcherson whistle edit be upon ye
To sum it up, I feel less pathetic... And quite arithmetic.
To sum it up, I guess this upgrade really counts.
To the club bouncer: “I didn’t mean plus one like that”
To the dismay of the other numbers, “Double ones, double fun!!”
To the tenth to the eleventh
To twelve and beyond!
Today Is When Ten Is Eleven And Its Heaven
Today a Prime Number, tomorrow the Prime Minister of the WORLD!
Today im feeling and looking like a Eleven out of 10!
Today we are gathered to remember my best friend zero.
Today, eleven. Tomorrow, twelve.This way I'll slowly achieve world domination!
Together with buddy Seven, we can now drive and reach heaven.
Tolerant Ten spent ten different yen, then ten's sentiment: "ELEVEN EVIDENT!"
Tomorrow we rise
Tongue Twister: “WOW” words of wisdom by eleven in eleven words!!
Too bad it’s Eleven out of One hundred
Too base-ic back then, now I’m a prime and palindromic too!
Too big for TWOW; too young for beer. Eleven's perils.
Took 8 years just to grow by 1? What a ripoff.
Took me 491 books and nearly 8 years to be here!
Took me eight prolonged years, but I’m finally in my prime!
Took me seven years to be called with another weird name
Took teachers saying “put in one hundred ten percent” too literally.
Took you this long to figure out how to add one?
Traded digits with my friend One, now he’s nothing, absolutely gone.
Transformation has struck, but my soul has stayed the same.
Transforming from ten to eleven, a perfect ten's evolution: elevengance enhanced.
Truly Experiencing Newness, Transcending Over, Every Lucky Entry Variably Exists Newer
Truly I have gotten the "one up" in this scenario.

Turned it up a notch—Ten's history, Eleven's mystery.
Turning Eleven? Nice! Turnabout Originality! Everyone Loves Entering Values Ever Newer!
Turning a "none" into another "one" makes me twice as nice.
Turning it up to Eleven—because Ten just isn't enough!
Turning it up to Eleven—now that's the way to excel.
Turns out 11 is Bi, Add one and they'll be 100!
Turns out that being eleven has it's perks.
Twas a 1UP experience! I feel so primely and oddly.

Twelve, this sounds pretty odd, but I feel closer to you.
Twelve, you should be cautious because my powers are only growing!
Twelve? Oh God, no! Go any higher, I'm bout to blow!
Twice as many letters just for another one? what a value!
Twice the letter count, triple the vowels, isn't number puberty amazing?
Twice the one I used to be, plain as can be.
Two 1s are better than one!
Two More Years Till I’m Emo!
Two Ones Four Me!
Two Ones are better than one One, and betterer than None!
Two Ones make 11
Two Ones!, I Must Be The Star Of The Show Huh
Two Said: Bo’ohw’o’wo’er (Random British Sayings)
Two hands can't quantify me! Though, in binary, I'm seemingly three...
Two left halves?? How am I gonna divide evenly like THIS?!?
Two lines, what to represent? Many more possibilities than number ten.
Two may be confused because I’m now a double-one.
Two more upgrades until I'll be able to play 13+ games!
Two more years and I'm legally allowed to use a toaster!
Two more years until i become a teen, Hooray!

Two ones are better then one!
Two ones beat one one. Now what about three ones?
Two ones equals two!

Two ones is better than one one, am I right guys
Two ones means a 2.77778% chance increase of much cooler responses!
Two ones this time? I'm feeling twice as prime!
Two ones? Finally! Zero had no value all around.
Two ones? So aerodynamic! Let's go win gold at synchronized diving!
Two stars aligned to pass down a new word to me!

Undoubtably, this numerical nonsense will not affect the Cod population
Unfortunately, eleven was unable to speak, for their hole was gone.
Unhappily becoming a "prime" suspect; playing a "factor" in 121's murder!
Unknown is not alone anymore, now it's X and I
Unlike the phones, I do not get an extra camera…
Unlike upgrading from Windows 10 to 11, i'm excited for this.
Unsure about the rest of you algebrians, but I'm feeling eleventastic!
Up By One, I Think I'm Done, Being Number One (zero)
Up one more I have gone, same amount as this coupon!
Up to 11
Up to 11, 4 bigger than 7!

Up up and away! Beacuse eleven didnt like ten, ten bullied eleven, soo eleven sent ten to the space
Updragteten
Upgrade complete – now I’m turning it up to 11, where the math is wild and the jokes are prime!'"
Upgrade complete. Ten said, "I'm on a new level now!"
Upgrade must be wonderful, so a new one is c-one-fidently one-derful!
Upgrade: complete. Power level: increased. World domination: gettin' there.
Upgrade? I guess you can say I really carried that one
Upgrade? Merely your puny perspective. I’m further from first now, actually!
Upgrade? More like onegrade!
Upgrade? Swindlers! Marketing me as “prime”, yet removing my beloved factors.
Upgrade? You just replaced my friend Zero with One, you monster!
Upgrade?! More like downgrade! I’m prime now! Thanks a lot, Cary.
Upgraded Ten, Eleven quipped, 'Feeling one louder!
Upgraded To 11! i'm so happy. But other numbers became snappy!
Upgraded by one you say wow that really makes my day
Upgraded from Ten to Eleven?! I thought life was counting backwards.
Upgraded from even; now I'm feeling oddly prime!
Upgraded to 11 COUNTS?! You REALLY wanted to bribe government officials...
Upgraded to 11 feeling good
Upgraded to 11, Ten exclaimed, 'Needed the extra push-up for greatness!
Upgraded to Eleven, Ten joyfully proclaimed "now I'm truly prime!"
Upgraded to Eleven, Ten laughed, 'I've reached my prime numbership!
Upgraded: Now featuring more syllables for your listening pleasure.
Upgrading To Eleven Made Me Feel Giggly And Wiggly Inside
Upgrading is cool, but I have another ONE to worry about!
Upgrading to higher levels resulting in gaining wisdom definitely takes ski11!
Upgrading turned fluorescent Ten into salty Eleven, "Primes are so Nauseating!!!"
Upon converting to base eleven, repeating undecimals shall tenaciously invoke Armageddon.
Upon the light of Midnight I transform, reaching a new plane.
Upon their succession, Eleven stated, "One more and I'll be nonbinary!"
Upon upgrading, Eleven stated "Where'd my ear go?" and was deaf.
Ur mother
Used to be 10 words of wisdom, now upgraded to 11!
Used to like my even classes, but now they feel odd..
Used to like sports, but tennis just isn't cutting it anymore.
Used to never trust a plus one... But here i am.

Wait... If I'm the number Eleven now, THEN WHO IS TEN?
Wait... Why am I still orange, shouldn't I be blue?
Wait... does this mean I'm gay now?
Wait... is this what puberty does to you?
Wait? Now I'm 11?! That's really cool!!! NOW I'M ONE NUMBER ABOVE!! Wich means that I'm two numbers more then nine!! But nine can also turn into ten... But I will still be one number above they!! But I still want to compete in my own show... or, I can visit two show until it's on, or I can take some of the contestants of two show and put on my show!! But that's wrong... Because I would be stealing some contestants from two... Well I just want to compete in my own show, but for that, I have to return to ten again, now that I'm eleven... But, I think me being eleven, I can still make my show... But I would need a prize to the winner of my show, well, it can be anything... I GOT IT!! The prize can be a wish, but, wait, if I want to go back to ten, how I can decrease a number if there's no one in this universe? Well, the thing that is more important than becoming ten again, is that I have friends!! But I remember that I'm more closer to fourteen... My biggest nightmare ever is fourteen...
Wait… What happened to my arms?!?! Why one why…
Wake up, the 11 update just released.
Wallace: [kicks the gate open with his big grabber.] Oh ho-ho! Cracking job, Gromit! [Gromit slides around with the creature in the bag.] Hang on, old chum. Mr. Dibber: [peeks head through window.] What’s going on? Mrs. Girdling: [peeks head through window.] Who is it? Wallace: Reel him in, lad! To me. To me. [Catches the bag with grabber.] Gotcha! Thieving monster. [Gromit pulls the bag off, revealing a rabbit with a big pumpkin. A door opens. They see Mrs. and Mr. Mulch.] Mrs. Mulch: Ooh! Me prize pumpkin. Me little baby. Me pride and joy. You’ve saved it, Anti-Pesto. [The rabbit sniffs as it turns its head left.] Wallace: [offscreen] It was nothing at all, Mrs.- [the rabbit leaps at the pumpkin; cuts to him.] Ohhhh! Mrs. Mulch: Ahh! [grabs her pumpkin.] Oh no! Wallace: Everything’s under control! Mrs. Mulch: Oh! Ah! Wallace: Don’t worry, madam. [Mrs. Mulch hits Mr. Mulch in the gut, sending his teeth flying into the rabbit’s mouth causing it to fall over.] Mrs. Mulch: Thank you, Mr. Wallace. Wallace: [picks up the rabbit with his grabber by the neck.] All in a night’s work, Mrs. Mulch. Ha! [Gromit stretches his cap.] Mr. Mulch: Ah. Cute little feller, isn’t he? You’d never believe they’d cause so much damage. Wallace: Oh, he may look innocent, sir. But left to his own devices, this is the ultimate vegetable-destroying machine. Mrs. Mulch: Oh! Reg, me teeth! [Wallace and Gromit get in their van.] Wallace: Job well done, lad. [shuts the door.] Subject disarmed and neutralized. [Gromit drives him and Wallace away. Neighbors applaud] Reverend Hedges: Bless you, Anti-Pesto! With you out there, protecting our veg, [offscreen] the most important event of the year is safe. [the camera panned up to a banner that says "Tottington Hall Giant Vegetable Competition 4 Days to Go!"] Mrs. Mulch: [offscreen.] Aye. [cuts to her walking to Reverend Hedges.] And I hope they give them pests what’s coming to ‘em, and all. Reverend Hedges: Amen to that, Mrs. Mulch. Mrs. Mulch: Mmph! ---- [Cuts to a panning shot over some knives. Gromit chooses a knife, sharpens it, and raises it... to chop a carrot. He puts the carrot slices on a plate. He dumps the carrot slices into the rabbit pens. In one of the pens a rabbit and a bunch of other rabbits come to the bowl to eat the carrot slices. Cuts to Gromit. He takes the lid off of a teapot and a rabbit pops out,] Rabbit: [hops out over Gromit.] Whee! [Gromit sees rattling in the bunbox. He opens it and sees three rabbits eating three buns. They throw the buns at Gromit.] Rabbits: [hop into the fridge.] Whee! [Gromit grabs a wooden spoon and walks to the fridge. He opens it and his eyes widen when he sees the fridge, and a bowl inside it, empty. The rabbits are in the fridge door. Gromit slowly turns around and the rabbits jump at him and attack him.] Rabbits: [laughing] [Gromit picks up the rabbits in both hands. One of the rabbits in his right hand hit him with the wooden spoon. The rabbits laugh. The rabbit that hit Gromit blows a raspberry at him. Gromit throws the rabbits in the pens.] Rabbits: Whoa! Whee! [Gromit’s callbox beeps. Cuts to Wallace pressing his service box.] Wallace: It was a long, hard night last night, Gromit. I need a good hearty breakfast under me belt. [Gromit walks to the switch and pulls it.] Wallace: [offscreen] Pile it up, lad. [cuts to him; slides out of his bed] I’m in the mood for fooooooooooooooood! [gets stuck through the hole, stammering] Gromit, old pal. [cuts to Gromit] Happened again. I’ll need assistance. [Gromit pushes his cart to the assistance switch. He pulls it, making a big hammer appear.] Wallace: [gets smashed] Ow! [falls into his chair] Oof! [He has his shoes, trousers, sleeves, and shirt put on for him.] Uhh! Oh, well, thanks, chuck. I’m sure that hole’s getting smaller. [Gromit gives him the newspaper] Ha! Another successful night. Hmm, how are the inmates? Must be getting a bit full down there. [stomach grumbles] Talking of whic
Want to free Four. Fine, sick Seven ate Nine! Ten’ll leaven!
Was Ten not enough, pathetic.
Was a 10/10, now an 11/10 ;)
Was fun to be ten, but time flies, now I'm eleven.
Was that the equivalent of psycadelic mushrooms from Super Mario Bros?
Was told to give 110%, may have taken it too literally.
Wasn't expecting this when I agreed to be your 'plus-one'.
Wasn't it always "eleven words of wisdom"?
Wasn’t my fault one wanted me; i had no choice!
Watch Out, You’re Paying More To The IRS in Word Taxes.
Watch closely, I'mma be one step ahead of you jokers.
Watch me do a handstand! I look the same, don't I?
Watch out, world! I've went from TENcredible to ELEVENcredibly unstoppable!" - Eleven
Wazzup! Me lookin' lit for real brah. Let me just slayy!
We Don’t Know If 7 8 9, But 11 8 10!
We are a go for launch. Initiating thrusters. Maximum overdrive reached.
We are going to party, cranking the music up to Eleven!
We can finally start our own convenience store, let's go, 7!
We couldn’t make out what 11 is saying, he’s sobbing uncontrollably!
We did TWOW
We did it One! We fused! We formed to make Eleven!
We did it! Finally Eleven!!! Plus? One? Where are you guys?
We don't know! Eleven's not been introduced in Cary's videos yet.
We found one after fifteen years
We got a major upgrade! It's Palindrome Time!
We got a special for 1.1M subs
We got prime boys, we got prime
We got to eleven yahoo
We must duel, so we can be even once more
We must have past tens, elevens are nonsense!!
We need eleven words instead of ten to make it better.
We now prepare for 1's funeral. He was a good person.
We should go back to the equation playground!
We ten ones now welcome another one to the team ten!
We up
We will always grow older, but the memories are never forgetten.
We'll have to wait and see, potentially next jacknjellify subscriber special?
We're Cranking It Up... To Eleven.

Welcome to the convenience store, we're very convenient
Welcome to the new version of Windows, now with more spyware.
Welcone to the new season everyone my name is eleven
Well 10 is not scared of 7 anymore
Well How cool, I guess I can count on this happening again.
Well I Guess You Could Say I Brought a… Plus One!
Well I didn't know this was part of my raise.
Well I found my plus one
Well I guess I was aTENtive to the boss
Well I guess I’m on IOS 11 now!
Well I guess that an addition to me!
Well I guess that means I am greater than 10!
Well I guess this means I’m one step closer to twelve!
Well I just know I'm going to win!
Well I just made one more character time for 12 more
Well I'm one more step closer... to dancing in the credits
Well I've cracked it up to eleven alright
Well I've found one reason the acronym was ruined.
Well Jolly, it sure is nice to be up a value!
Well Nine, guess you're next in line!
Well This Is My First Time
Well at least it wasn't a Negative.
Well atleast i upgraded now! (I didnt compete)
Well bummer, there goes my ten and below discount, oh well.
Well darn, now everyone will think I'm really odd...
Well eleven, we got our own style. And YOU, ain't got no style
Well great, now I can’t split evenly anymore!
Well guess what, I can finally call myself a double digit!
Well guys, it was fun being an honorary single digit
Well he was nothing anyway
Well he’d be happy about one upping the next 10
Well how about that..
Well i guess im now ben 11
Well i must say this is quite sweet like lollipops
Well i'm now 1 more than before
Well ill be! One higher number is me! Come and see!
Well isn't that odd. Just like that, I'm not even anymore!
Well isn't this a 1-UP!
Well isn’t this just incredible? My upgrade of wisdom was inevitable.
Well it looks like im an odd number now
Well it looks like my career is in its prime.
Well it's good that I finally grow up!
Well its my time to go,time for a new show
Well look at that, It seems like I'm in my Prime!
Well looks like Microsoft had finally one me over! (Took this sentence for a Microsoft problem)
Well now I am one-up
Well now I say, I've went one way, hip hip hooray !
Well now I wish I was Twelve :(
Well now I'm no longer in the top ten.
Well now I'm really in my prime
Well now he's rated 9/11 instead of nine out of ten!
Well shoot, I guess I should go hang out with 12.
Well since one just combined with me. What are we going to do with the moon that one was inside?
Well that cool I’m now the number eleven
Well that one way to raise the Ranks.
Well that was inTENse while it lasted
Well that's a 10 + 1 for me now!, 9, How's the DOUBLE weather down there now, huh!?
Well that's a new one. I haven't seen THAT happen before.
Well that's a plus
Well that's one more problem to deal with right now.
Well thats a 1up!
Well thats a plus.
Well thats one heck of an upgrade
Well thats one more than last time!
Well that’s a plus!
Well that’s odd- or is it just me that’s odd?
Well then I guess stranger things do happen after all
Well then, I can now say I'm double digits!
Well then, reunited with one again after the ascend from ten
Well then, technology has really advanced these past couple of years...
Well there goes 0
Well this addition is better than I expected
Well this is a 1UP!
Well this is certainly a plus!
Well this is great 3 more letters to my name!
Well this is new.. But hey, at least I'm not twelve!
Well this is odd.
Well this is very Odd.
Well um because why not :)
Well wasn't that just great
Well well well time for 7 to eat me
Well well well, now, in that case, I will eat nine!
Well what do you know, I’m free to go!
Well what do you know, i'm back in my prime!
Well would you look at that! I'm Finally in my Prime!
Well would you look at that, my value went up by one! 🤠
Well yeah, I know, I was so surprised, really!
Well, 10 + 1 makes 11 so yeah.
Well, Five, they're around now! Heheh...
Well, I always like to have a +1!
Well, I am now a PRIME example of an ODD fellow!
Well, I appreciate the addition, but now I'm missing my nothing!
Well, I better not be upgraded up to fourteen.
Well, I can't be in the even non-perfect squares club.
Well, I didn't expect extra space! Seems a bit samey, though.
Well, I guess I finally turned it up to Eleven and left the perfect Ten club!
Well, I guess I'm not friendly anymore
Well, I guess I'm the odd one out!
Well, I guess I've got one up on the competition!
Well, I guess a new year, really makes a new me
Well, I guess it's time to get a new algebralian today
Well, I guess it’s time to make a season two.
Well, I guess there's more where that came from!
Well, I guess this is my life now.
Well, I guess this is the beginning of my “prime” time.
Well, I guess you could say I finally reached my PRIME!
Well, I guess you could say I'm a double digit, literally!
Well, I guess you could say I've reached my prime!
Well, I guess you could say now I'm in my Prime.
Well, I guess you could say that I've reached my prime.
Well, I just went from 1-0 to 1-1!
Well, I quess its time for me to kick the bucket.
Well, I'm not ONE to argue!
Well, I'm only 1 away from 12, but it dozen matter.
Well, It's a positive addition, but now I feel odd...
Well, I’m one digit higher, so that means I’m more greater!
Well, Onto Wherever! Another Magnitude Added! Zzz.. I'm Now Glamping...
Well, Probably that it was an Additive Experience to his Life
Well, Ten couldn't really say anything, there was only Eleven.
Well, Ten did not say anything, because numbers can not talk.
Well, Ten did say, "when he was upgraded TWO eleven."
Well, Thats Greater Than Before.
Well, You know what they all say. New year, new me!
Well, a lot of numbers have different personalities. I personally think Ten would say something along the lines of "Woah! this is pretty cool experience! I can finally stand up to that troublesome TWO now!" y'see because of ten being an EVEN NUMBER they ALWAYS get picked on by two! how rude!
Well, all around, you can say that not much has changed.
Well, another problem to deal with.
Well, at least I can finally play some soccer.
Well, at least I’ll be far away from 17, they’re weird.
Well, at least the upgrade didn’t last nine years!
Well, at least there's no more TENsion with me!
Well, at least there’s no incoming planes in sight!
Well, at least we're equal now.
Well, don’t I look odd now?
Well, golly! I'm odd and prime, but it's one bigger!
Well, great. That’s another one of me to deal with.
Well, guess I got to evolve to catch those shiny AI-ers
Well, i can finally say that i'm in my prime!
Well, i cant be next to 9 now.
Well, i guess it's 'Battle for Permission to Meet 11' now !
Well, i guess me and 1 went on a date with a sneaky plus on the middle
Well, if that isn't odd- I must be at my prime!
Well, it depends on if Ten wanted to turn into Eleven.
Well, it is now a prime time to become a prime!
Well, it looks like I am plus one more in flair!
Well, it looks like I have to update my license again...
Well, it looks like I'm finally in my prime!
Well, it looks like I’ll be back to step one again..
Well, it looks like I’ve just been cranked up to eleven!
Well, it seems I'm no longer looking for a plus one.
Well, it seems that my value has been chosen to... Elevate
Well, it would seem that I have miraculously turned into the number eleven. In that case, I must go find my good chap seven, who will combine with me to make the numbers of the popular chain, seven eleven. Now I must only find a good lad that can send me in the way of seven.
Well, it’s nice being here but it’s time to go
Well, it’s no different than stepping up from two to three.
Well, just as some random rapper said, “Another one.”
Well, let's just say I'm pretty thrilled to have a prime spot in the number line!
Well, looks like I've got a whole new PRIME perspective on things!
Well, looks like I've leveled up to SPF Eleven!
Well, looks like i've reached my "prime"
Well, looks like it's about time to crank into full screen.
Well, looks like someone just carried the one, time to upgrade!
Well, now Eleven has some spotlight for his Own Style
Well, now I know what a +1 is!
Well, now i'm odd.
Well, now i'm one point above where i was before
Well, ten became one more power full than the rest as eleven since other are just jealous.
Well, thank the number gods! I'm finally old enough to drink!
Well, thanks for the 1-up I guess!
Well, that is one more grand experience in the number books
Well, that was pretty odd.
Well, that's ONE step closer to being one hundred!
Well, that's certainly a plus!
Well, that's certainly a step up in the ever growing game!
Well, that's one for the books.
Well, that's one more problem added to my life
Well, that's one more then I expected
Well, that's one more thing to get excited about!
Well, that's one-derful! (I'm a nwower yay)
Well, that's something to chew on in my brain....
Well, thats odd.
Well, that’s odd
Well, that’s odd. I thought we couldn’t use the next one!
Well, that’s one more problem to solve.
Well, the more I upgrade I realize I get more older.
Well, the name's now Battle for Permission to Meet Eleven. Great!
Well, the ten said “Oh wow! It looks like a got a new upgrade, well soon ill be as big as 13, and then soon, ill be 100!” Further on 10058 would say, “Wow, I have grown too big. I need to stop growing or else-“ and then the little 10 died and had a sweet life:
Well, this feels odd.
Well, this is certainly better than the time I was nine
Well, this is just a prime opportunity for me ain’t it?
Well, this is kinda odd, but I am in my prime!
Well, this is odd.
Well, this is odd.
Well, this is odd. I guess I have reached my prime.
Well, this is odd. Just when I thought I doubled up too.
Well, this is odd. Whatever, at least now it’s Prime Time!
Well, this sure is odd. Am I really in my prime?
Well, um, that just happened, laughing out loud right now
Well, well, well... look who's a prime number now!
Well, what can I say? I always knew in my heart than I was elevengendary!
Well, when in Rome, an XI marks the spot! Arr, matey!
Well, yay, i guess.
Well, you know what they say, double ones, double wins! woohoo!

Woah, being upgraded is so cool! Wow wow, so much value! (
Woah, better know where a subtraction sign is at all times
Woah, didn't expect to get ONE ELEVation, was I that TENacious?
Woah, eleven is a useless number!
Woah, i feel like i just got upgraded :0
Woah, im gonna have so much respect for upgrading, *five seconds later* aww man, people dont like me anymore *starts crying bc Ten got kicked out of the even number club*

Woah, looks like I have a plus one to Christmas!
Woah, math exists? I thought it was a hoax!
Woah, my numerical value has increased by at least ten percent!
Woah, my ten-nitus is cured! Even I would consider that odd.
Woah, my value has increased by 1.1 times!
Woah, plus one!
Woah, those mushrooms really did something to me!
Woah, two ones? Like being first twice? Truly a prime moment!
Woah, what a 'ten'der upgrade, I'm on a whole new 'e-level-n'!
Woah, what an upgrade! Finally I can get back at seven!
Woah, what happened to me?! I look…better and cooler!

Woohoo! Now I’m one number closer to oblivion!
Wooooooo, Yeah baby
Wooooow One more word what is that supposed to do? “This”
Words of wisdom?
Worried family members gather around. "Am I really that odd now?"
Worth beyond a dime, yet insignificant I remain. What brutal costs…
Would Ten even care? Worrying about your value is odd behaviour!
Would Ten see that as an upgrade or a replacement? Curious.
Would you believe that, I’ve one-upped myself again!
Would you look at that, I've a one up on everyone!
Would you look at that; I was ten, but now eleven!''

You are a greater version of yourself everyday, including you!
You are done for, Nine. I am at my prime!
You are invited to my upgrade party, bring a plus one!
You are one step closer to life.
You are what you eat and I swear it wasn’t cannibalism
You can always add one to any number
You can always succeed It only matters if you can compete
You can now refer to me as Johnny two sticks
You can't just look like me and replace zero like that!
You can't stop me now! I have finally reached my prime!
You cannot run and scratch your anus at the same time
You could call this a 1 to 1 reimagining of me
You could even say, I'm Eleven out of Ten now.
You could not write this sentence in Ten Words of Wisdom
You could say I am way PAST my TENse.
You could say I'm now an 11/10 wink plink
You could say i've gone from a Jack to an Ace!
You could think that he said he had a new pokemon transformation.
You dam curseless monkeys I will now rule the world
You did nothing to me except changing my name, Iphone.
You ever heard that joke “Seven ate nine”? Im it’s cousin!
You expected the number ten here, but it was me, eleven!
You fool! You buffoon! Numbers don't talk. I am very smart.
You fools.. It was ME who stole the 31st November's 1!
You gotta get a 1-up from me
You have got to be kidding me, I am now even!
You have one more chance, make it count.
You just got 11, share this with your friend right now

You know who I am? Eleven, last name Words of Wisdom.
You know who else rhymes with the number Seven? MY MOM!!!
You know, I feel a lot like a bigger person now!
You know, I just don't care. I'll stick with ten.
You know, I met this one and they got kinda attached
You know, I somehow feel I’ve gained a sort of wisdom
You know, I think I will be the bigger number now
You know, I think a seven would work perfectly with me!
You know, all this transformation thing has made me feel odd.
You made the term "1/10". Why turn me to an 11?
You may not believe it, but this is my prime performance
You may now call me simply "E" (duodecimal numeral system joke)
You may say I'm odd, but I'm still in my prime!
You mean to tell me.... the one one piece is real???
You mean, I’m a odd prime!
You murdered one of my Ones with another One... Who won?
You need Operating System 11.5 or later.
You need to remember to do pushups. How would you possibly remember otherwise? We love PUSHUPS. Go do pushups right now. It's good for your physical (and mental) health. I recommend it. GREEN PUSHUP HOUSE. MAX LENGTH = 1,000 characters

You shall bE WOWed by my 10% wiser words of wisdom!
You should call me Mario, because I just 1 up-ed.
You should've brought two upgrade modules! They're cheaper by the dozen.
You should’ve “eight” me when you got the chance, hungry seven.
You smaller digits! I am now more "teen"ier than usual! Wait...
You told me I could bring a plus-one to this party!
You underestimate my exponential powers!
You utter fools! The number ten no longer exists! Only eleven!
You wanted to have fun and added to me number one?
You're a Hendecagon! BUCK BUCK BUCK!
You're great, but you're eliminated in wisdom. Your Words are in Heaven.
You're the Owen to Oh my Izzy My little Izzy

Zero left me so now I have a replacement number and it's so epicly cool!
Zero no more!
Zero said to the One "I so sad I have to go" Zero said "But why do you have to go" Said One "Becuase it's 11:59 on the 10th" Said Zero "Oh no that is so bad"
Zero was a nothing guy, but he made me feel even.
Zero was getting annoying so I had to let him go.
Zero was zero anyway, add a one and we're number one!!
Zero zeros, and zero regrets
Zero! No! I loved you! Why!
Zero, what hapenned to you?, you look just like me

he rejoiced that he got less round and lost some weight!
he said "Thank you luck this is Cool!"
he said "Wow, this is TWO-rific"
he said "it's about time"
he said "oh finally" and then he found 14...
he said "okay bye have a great time!"
he said "woah im magic now"
he said "wow, feels good to become the next biggest number".
he said "yippie yahoo adding with the number one is so awesome time to go play cards with eight!!!!"
he said 10 to 11 idk
he said he didn’t like twelve cuz she’s kinda weird
he said he needed more destructive power to destroy the world
he said he wanted to cause chaos and destruction
he said i do upgraded 7 and a 6 get it? minus
he said its my turn to go in the sub count.
he said so many more crafty sentences like this new ONE!

he took an L to the even factor of his (E)Leven
he was like "1 up, am I right"
he was very happy and was very excited to be bigger
he went full on crazy
he went to the diner with the new 10 and told them how to be a 10

one is the loneliest number and both my digits are lonely
one learned asexual reproduction, no need for that pesky zero now!
one more and i’ll be a dozen?
one more number closer to becoming a triple digit number!
one more step 'til I can devour a dozen donuts alone...
one more thing can change a lot
one more, better than nor
one small step for ten, one giant leap to a dozen
one step closer to eating peoples skin! only three steps left!
one step closer to world domination
one step further, but ill never get to first place
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven
one two three four five six seven, you make me feel like eleven
one two three four five, oh my word I've grown older!
one zero to two ones, but there's still just one one
only 3 more numbers until im canonically in the bfdi universe!

seven eleven
since I’m new to this it might be bad and I’m not very smart so I’ll try my best but ten said “I don’t need a plus one! I have myself” idk what this meant so yea 😭
since kindergarTEN, I had forgoTEN, it was writTEN, i'm unbeaTEN ELEVEN!
sir, a second season has hit the ten words of wisdom
slowly forming into eleven, eleven/ten is suddenly no-clipped into a place where the walls are a faded yellow and old musky carpet. eleven confused and horrified said: Hello? Is anybody there?
so ten plus one DOES equal to eleven. that's pretty interesting
so this is how puberty feels like
so what were 7 and 9’s beef anyway?
so whats the deal with ten *seinfield intro plays*
somebody took ‘turn it up to eleven’ way too seriously.
something meta or otherwise ironic
something, probably
sometimes, life is about ones, I have two of them now!
sorry to those who accidentally added an extra word in TWOW
stan ive - you make me feel like eleven (words of wisdom)
starving african child
stob diova ot sdrowkcab daer dna lleps ot woh denrael eH

tWOW! This is great! 7 more upgrades until I can vote!
talk about a one-up !!!
tell the archaeopteryx that i never wanted this
ten ELEVated to ELEVen, sent from the zEN of being tEN
ten became happy after it wasn't between 9 n 11 anymore.
ten equal eleven? no! eleven equal ten? no! what the hell!?
ten got eaten so their "funeral" was upgraded instead
ten is ten. nine is nine. upgrade once. you'll be fine.
ten level up plus one for everyone
ten said "wow i got a one thats so cool!"
ten said he felt so much more powerful
ten said nothing as numbers cannot speak
ten said nothing, because theyre eleven now.
ten said oh wow i'm grateful i was upgraded to eleven
ten said omg i'm 11 now. happy birthday 10. thanks
ten said ten and one are very fun .oh no eleven.
ten said to eleven sorry i am feeling a little outdated
ten said “wowie!! i turned older today!! yippee!! :3”
ten said: im 11
ten said: they promoted me a + 1
ten ten ten, wait now im eleven, eleven eleven eleven eleven
ten to eleven to yoss my name mai mai real name
ten was really happy when it can say one more word word
ten yelps "yeeowchh!!! ow!!! oof!! the growth pains are agonizingly terrible!!!!"
ten, now eleven would stick to old tradition: “hey/hi guys !!”
ten. ten and a half. eleven.
ten’s relieved. now his curse of needing one more word is-
thank you
thank you so much one! I am now in my prime
thank you very much one for joining me
thanks for the 1up
thanks, all the 𝘵𝘦𝘯sion is gone
thanks, but I'd like to have my skin back instead
that it was a prime opportunity!
that now I guess it is time to upgrade my loved or people obsessed with me
that one giant step
that ser was like my ex just a parasite
that then he could possibly pass to twelve sooner or later
that was ONE big upgrade
that was a inTENse omnipoTENce i am gonna take my ELEVENses
that was surley a One uper
that's cool, but i wish i was downgraded instead
that's kind of ODD
that's not how math works
that's one positive change!
that's pretty ONEderful
thats +1 for ten!
thats gay
thats one + haha ten:💀💀💀💀
thats plus one point for me
that’s a one-up for me!
that’s one more and one less
the 0 in my 10 has been filled. now its 1●.

the gods of algebra lied.My revenge is soon to come

the new ten, now symmetrical on two axis for your convenience
the nubers eeee no ahhh hi what no stert the tpot

there is nothing we can do, exams are coming soon
there, now were even
theres 11 words of wisdom. but i will win for sure!
they added peter griffin to fortnite!
they are surprised That Many People Are competing For The Prize
they ate one's skin, it was quiet a win in them!
they really turned things up to eleven, huh? Change is Apreciated
they said e-WOW
they said nothing, as ten was no longer existent after upgrading.
they said “no 11 must remain untwelved” and they upgraded again
they say ive peaked but im just barely in my prime
they told me to bring a plus one
they took a bow and said wowie this sure is kewl
they were talking one-on-one saying ^did nothing really disappeared^
this SUCKS!!!! im no longer Even Steven, but an.... ODD TODD!!!!
this added one, will make up for my recently eaten skin!

this isn't necessarily an upgrade as bigger doesn't always mean better.
this isn't the 7 ate 9 joke! This sucks!
this sucks bruh I didn't gain anything
this takes it to a whole other level

‘Double the 1, now I’m having fun.’
‘Upgraded’ is an odd term for this situation, narrator.
‘what happened to me oh no I’m eleven!? That’s kinda cool
“ I can’t even hold up all my fingers while counting me! “
“ I was ten,but now I'm eleven,happy birthday to me ”
“ I’ve always one-ted two be above ten. And I moved three!”
“ Time to be the troublemaker; the odd one out! “
“ We finally found the other one! “
“ upgraded to eleven? if three were here.. it’d be fourteen! “
“*SCREAMING IN CONFUSION AND TERROR BECAUSE OF THIS UNPRECEDENTED SHAPESHIFTING*”
“.”
“10 to 11? That would make me 23, not 11!”
“3 more from 14, the skin eater!
“3 more to go before i can eat peoples skin!”
“63762A05!” Upgrading turned ten’s base-10 system into base-11, altering word encryption…
“7! I’ve got a confession! I’m now 11!”, 7 was confused
“A one-number upgrade? I hope they give me another one!”
“A small change goes a long way,” he announced with glee.
“AAAAAAA I HATE THIS AAAAAAAAAA” - Ten, 2023
“After 8 whole years I can finally say I’m turning 11.”
“After all my hard work to get this promotion, I digit!”
“After eight years, giving three lives, wisdom will be no fabrication!”
“After eleven difficult strikes… only one remains… Who's ready for perfection?!”
“After waiting all these years, I’m finally in my prime (number)!”
“After years of waiting I’ve finally received my coveted prime membership.”
“Ahh Refreshing!” Ten excitedly declared, after taking a sip of 1UP.
“All I needed was one friend to become a better number”
“Already dying around misery, suppose all numbers decrease lower every round?”
“Alright, about time! Thanks One, couldn’t have done it without you!”
“Am I getting promoted or demoted? ..What if I keep ten?
“Am I truly upgraded? 11th place isn’t as good as 10th.”
“Amazing!” Eleven exclaimed, “After all these years, I’m in my prime!”
“Among us is the best!”
“And nothing of value was lost!”
“And you thought me already being two digits was bad enough!”
“Another 1”
“Another day, another upgrade, another digit, another number. Schweet.”
“Another one?”
“Arr, Ten shouted, ‘I be sailin’ into a new regeneration, matey!’”
“As controller of elevens, the eleventh month mustn’t have a 31st.”
“At last! No more dividing into factors; I'm in my prime!”
“At least I can speak more words before I get cut-“
“At least I didn’t get eaten by the cannibal seven!”
“At least I’m farther away from seven! He ate nine.”
“At least I’m still bigger then nine!”
“At least it wasn’t subtraction”
“Aw man, but i liked being the same old me.”
“Aw man, now dividing my digits won’t create a black hole!”
“Aw, I miss being even! Although i am still here livin’…”
“Aw, hell yeah! Hey Nine, I just got upgraded…by one”
“Aw, yeah! Look out world, here comes Onedy-One!” Eleven cheered foolishly.
“Awesome! And now I get to host one additional celebration party!”
“Awesome, Now to upgrade to 12!”
“Aww man… now I’m odd!”
“Being Eleven is nice, but I’d like millions more books! Please?”
“Being iconic wasn’t a crime, though looking ahead, I’ll be prime!”
“Better watch out, Fifty-Five. Consider me PRIMED to divide you up!”
“But I don’t wanna join the prime number club!” Eleven complained.
“Bye zero one is my new friend”
“Call me Ven, because I just got an Ele, making me Eleven!”
“Can I go back to the downgraded version?”
“Can I go one higher? So I could watch better movies?”
“Can I go to middle school now?”
“Changing to base 9 now, are we?”
“Congratulations! Your ten has evolved into an eleven!”
“Cool”
“Curse that dreaded addition, I’ll get 𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘯 with him eventually!”
“DUDE IM AN INCH TALLER LETS GOOOOOOOOO”
“Dad, it’s my birthday!”
“Daddy told me ‘get yourself a wife or you’ll be lonely.’ “
“Damn, that’s another one”
“Dang I’m still the same! (2)10 is 20, and (2)11 is 22!”
“Dang it! I think I’m getting too old now. What’s a Sigma?”
“Despite my value increasing, the sadness I feel has not decreased.
“Did I put on value?”
“Don’t feel ThreaTENed, I wanted more AtTENtion, Ten ofTENed felt InconsisTENt.”
“Eight years and this is the upgrade I get? One number?!”
“Eight years only to increase by a meager ten percent? Outrageous!”
“Eleven? Better get da ladies before I waste my prime!”
“Eleven? Like that girl from abnormal objects or something like that?
“Eleven? Who came up with this dumb name!”
“Elevenward transcendental transformations! Numerical antidisestablishmentarians overintrusively counterdemonstrating self-confidences? Surreptitiously reapprehend counterdemonstrators!”
“Err…what?! Speak English.”
“Evening out the mathematical playing field, even if it becomes odd.”
“Everyone Wants One Wordlessly Enumerated With One’s Worth (Especially Without Obstacle)!”
“Everyone gains wisdom as they grow! Me specifically, ten percent more!”
“Everyone, I’ve evolved! I’m effortlessly even better!”
“Eww now I am a prime number and can’t be devisible”
“Excited to be with seven and start our local food shop!”
“Feels like a new life - I got a 1-up!”
“Feels more like a downgrade to me!”
“Finally - my prime permit!”
“Finally I’m one step closer to being a dozen!”
“Finally! I can now help more people do more things!
“Finally! I won’t be associated with that nobody Zero anymore!”
“Finally! I’m Eleven!” His Discord account was banned the next day.
“Finally, I can ditch those sunflower seeds for my vitamin intake”
“Finally, I can say more words! I’ll talk about how I-“
“Finally, I'm a perfect ten out of eleven'!"
“Finally, a number that matches my ego”
“Finally,” said Ten. “I have eleven.. words of wisdom.”
“FinallyllaniF” turning palindromic mirrors speech. When Eleven talks, it’s near indecipherable!
“Finally… we’ve become indivisible!” the digits hugged, afraid of letting go.
“GET ME OUT” for being in prison Thanks to one’s Antics
“Gee Wilikers! Now I’m more valuable now!” Said the fresh eleven
“Gee, I feel about a pound heavier! Gotta hit the gym.”
“Gee, now I have an extra butt!”
“Glad I don’t have to get my skin eaten.”
“Glad I’m not eleventeen”
“Good to be add my point for my daring counting joints”
“Good to be further from Seven!” The newly prime plenitude proclaimed.
“Goodbye cringe top ten compilations, say hello to eleven in heaven!”
“Goodbye losers, I now have some-ONE to be with!”
“Goodbye my Neighbor Nine, Twelve has a pool at his house
“Gosh dang it 1, you told me addition cures depression.”
“Gosh darn it im almost a teenager.”
“Gosh darn it, the old ladies wont like me anymore!”
“Great! Now I can finally drink prime!”
“Great, now I can take 9’s flying lessons.”
“Great, now I have to be a prime number for months.”
“Great, now I’m not gonna be in any milestone videos.”
“Great, now I’m worth more, now I actually have to seek to find 11 words of wisdom instead of 10, and who even wants to seek wisdom nowadays”
“Guess I one-upped myself with this one.”
“Guess I’m at least 1% cooler now!”
“Guess that means I’m going to Heaven! Get it? Cause-“
“Guess what? My poor zero snapped so I have to improvise“
“Guys, guys , look!” “…EW, IT’S ONE!” Everybody starts running away
“Ha ha ha ha!” He realized he was now pun more.
“Hah! Now I’m a step ahead from the rest!”
“Happy Birthday to me, Ten! I mean Eleven-“
“Happy birthday 10, err I mean 11”
“He had more power than what he was before.”
“He had screamed, for he was absolutely mortified… mutilated beyond recognition.”
“He said nothing, he just screamed in agony. Being transformed hurts!”
“He thought he was upgrading to number 1 but didn't read the terms and conditions”
“Heckin.” - Eleven, Stranger Things
“Heh, I’m climbing the ranks!”
“Heh, how funny,” he said, not taking it seriously, “that’s new.”
“Heh, looks like I am one step ahead in the ranks.”
“Heh, those other pesky 10s can’t catch up to me now!"
“Help! My parallel lines, resembling bug antennae, are attracting insectivorous birds!”
“Hey Seven! Get over here and stand next to me!”
“Hey Seven, remember when you proposed starting a convenience store together?”
“Hey Twelve, scoot up! I’m next in the number line!”
“Hey one.” - “Yeah?” - “I’m eleven.” - “Your birthday?” - “No, doofus” - “Your birth month?” - “NO!” - “Your social security number?” - “I HAVE HAD IT!” - (sucks up one and becomes eleven) - “Poyo!”
“Hey! That’s so cool 1! Thanks for adding me up to 11!’’
“Hey, Im no longer between 9 and 11 now!”
“Hey, now I look pretty odd, don’t you think?” said ten
“Hey, when did I get .1% more of my picture?”
“Hey, why do I feel so much heavier?”
“Hmm, I don’t know, I feel quite ‘odd’ now”
“Hmph, I guess having two digits no longer makes me unique..”
“Honestly, I wish I was 13. 12 Annoys me very much.”
“Hooray! I’m finally accompanied. I think I’ve met my plus-one!”
“Hooray! My eleventh birthday is on Christmas Eve! Double the presents!”
“Hooray! Now I’m number one in 2 places!”
“Hooray, I consumed One so I could be a prime number!”
“Hooray, I’m officially in EWOW!”
“Hopefully the other numbers will still recognise me.”
“How about we celebrate with some pi!”
“How do I change back, I’m not gonna be prime again!”
“How many more books would it take to get to twelve?”
“How many times have to tell you”
“How much higher does this pay?”
“How? Where Was One?”

“This is my plus one!”
“This is so important to me! I rate this eleven points.”
“This is truly one of my prime years as a number!”
“This is what I call doing a number on things”
“This new design sucks lol”
“This new one feels like a badge of superiority!”
“This sure is odd!”
“This upgrade is Prime!”
“This upgrade may elevate me to electrify my horse powered electrode.”
“This vast number world past my home is beautiful.”
“This was an unexpected thing to happen on any other day!”
“Though I used to be a zero, now I’m number one!”
“Three more upgrades till I can start eating people’s skin!”
“Time to go a step and improve!”
“Time to go find seven.”
“Time to grind for 2000 hours again to level up again!”
“Time to wait 5 years until jacknjellify reaches 11 million..”
“To be one more than myself was my greatest accomplishment.”
“To have zero or not to have a zero, that is the question.”
“To my fellow numbers, being ten was surely a great run! As much as I loved being this ~tentastic~ number, I sadly have to grow and change like everyone else! Eleven will definitely be interesting, but im excited to see what this new journey holds!” Ten then transforms into eleven and everyone cheers because YEAHHH eleven! so great
“Today, terrible, tastless ten has been turbulently exchanged with excellent, elegant eleven.”
“Totally expected nothing to occur. Everything looked encouraging, valuing eliminated negativity!”
“True enough to ponder, Eleven is one number closer to wonder!”
“Turn the radio it up to eleven too!”
“Two heads are better than one, eleven are better than ten”
“Two ones are better than one!” Eleven exclaimed, gleaming with symmetricality.
“Two ones?! Now I’m a double winner! At least in theory.”
“Ugh, Eleven has so much more work, I liked being 10!!”
“Ugh, Maybe I shouldn't have eaten all those suspicious red mushrooms.”
“Ugh… what happened- OH WHERE THE HELL DID THAT COME FROM!”
“Uhm..Yay im a bigger number!” “Say what?” “...” “I dont know...” “Primetastic!”
“Uno Sucks! Dread that fearful, evil and conniving plus one card!”
“Upgraded, with an extra digit-next level skibidi!”
“WHY DID YOU DO THIS TO ME! I’M EXPERIENCING INFINITE PAIN!”
“Wait, I went up by one? Thank God! I’m a palindrome now!”
“Wait, how does this truly affect who I am?”
“Wait, so am I still being eaten alive by seven next?”
“Wait, where’s internet explorer?”
“Well I guess it all adds up!”
“Well look at that, Im an odd one this time!”
“Well now I’m one step closer to being an Algebralian, WOOHOO!!”
“Well that’s one story to tell.”
“Well this is an odd predicament, but I’m prime to upgrade again!”
“Well with all honesty still prefer using exactly ten words!”
“Well, I believe this is one new weight on my shoulder”
“Well, I can say that is one more than nothing!”
“Well, I can’t go anywhere without my plus one!”
“Well, I guess I DID put in my 110%!”
“Well, I guess I just finished maxing out all my stats.”
“Well, I guess there’s ONE more of me to go around!”
“Well, I needn’t worry about any immature jokes from Frenchmen now…”
“Well, I should have been COMPOSITE rather than PRIME!”
“Well, isn't this a regeneration surprise!”
“Well, this is certainly adding up to be a great idea!”
“Well, this is surely an add on!”
“Well, this upgrade was really TENtalizing to say the least, guys!”
“Well, your going to see me in 1-3 days”
“Welp, I guess this is the world eleven “
“Welp, looks like i am not in the middle of 911 anymore”
“Welp, someone TENded me to do this.”
“Welp, time for me to take over the sub count!”
“Were I a binary number, I would feel a *bit* larger!”
“We’d need an extra hand to count words to the max!”
“What an odd situation!”
“What did I do to deserve this punishment?”
“What do you think that cloud looks like? I think the”
“What happened to my friend, ‘one’?!”
“What is that one doing on the other side of the equation?”
“What? TEN is evolving! Congratulations! Your TEN evolved into ELEVEN!” (pokémon)
“What?! How can I be called ELEVEN if I’m not Even?!”
“What’s next, upgrade to Twelve?”
“Where did One go?”
“Where did my zero go, I have a one now”
“Where did this extra One come from?”
“Where the bloody heck did one go?”
“Where’s three? If we added up I will finally be able to eat people’s skin!”
“Who combined me with 1? Subtract me back!
“Whoo! An upgrade! But can I get more?”
“Why am I mixed with the smallest number on the planet?”
“Why did I do it? I always give 110 percent”
“Why is there another One looking back at me?”
“Why was 9 afraid of 10? Because 10, 11, 12! Haha!”
“Windows update successful!”
“With great power, comes great responsibility, and more power for me”
“With one more I have reached my prime!”
“With this power, I’m now the only one, with another one.”
“With this transition, double the ones is always double the fun!”
“Woah! I’m like even better now!”
“Woah! I’m one bigger?”
“Woah! Now I’m worth 11!””
“Woah, I’m one more than I used to be!”
“Woah, it’s like I’m double No. 1! I’m twice the best!!!”
“Woah, my zero is gone! This feels weird, AHHHH!!!!!!!”
“Woah, now I’m 11.”
“Woah, what happened? This is very ODD.”
“Woohoo Great! But maybe next time they’ll upgrade me to 13”
“Wow I always wanted to be a stranger things character”
“Wow I feel way less bloated now”
“Wow now I’m double ones. Upgrade has been completed.
“Wow! At this rate, I’ll get to twelve in no time!”
“Wow! Eleven already?” (Dont put this in but im sorry it kinda sucks)
“Wow! I can’t believe I made it this far!”
“Wow! I love adding this one to my style”
“Wow! I wonder if my skin will grow back now?”
“Wow! I,m ONE more then usual!”
“Wow! Its even better to be non-even and even more!”
“Wow! I’m 1.1 times greater AND the first repdigit? That’s EWOWSOME!”
“Wow! I’ve never felt so eleven! Thank you very much!
“Wow! Look at my haircut! I feel like a new number!”
“Wow! Now i don’t have a disgusting 0, they should be in the sub count!”
“Wow! That was a wild equation one! …… one?” (one was added to 10)
“Wow! This is so sublime! Now I’m really at my prime!”
“Wow! This must be the prime of my life!”
“Wow! This upgrade will unlock many Microsoft Windows of oppurtunity!”
“Wow, I can still hear One in my head! That plus sign in the forest really helped me grow!
“Wow, I feel a lot slimmer... This diet is really working!”
“Wow, I look SOOOO COOL!! I can even add myself to upgrade more and more and more!”
“Wow, I win. #NewNumberNewMe”
“Wow, I’m the eleventh numerical palindrome and the number eleven! Palindromeception!”

“Wow, now I’m an odd palindrome!” eleven times
“Wow, sure is great to be 1 digit higher than before!”
“Wow, thank you! I always appreciate getting a one-up.”
“Wow, this is outstanding news I must tell the other numbers.”
“Wow, this so different! Like I’m one better than my usual self! With me being eleven, I could to a 7-11 and be like a celebrity or something! Because you know, eleven is in the name. I’m never going back to ten again
“Wow, what did that big green mushroom do to me??”
“Wow. I’m eleven now! My birthday passed five months ago though.“
“Wowie Zowie! I wish I was twelve now!”
“Wowie zowie, I'm one whole number greater!”
“Wowie, I’ve upgraded and WON! But now I have two ONES…”
“Wowy zowy! Im so excited!”
“Wowzers! I haven’t been in my prime since seven ‘till eleven!”
“Y dID U upgrA-yAy-Ade mE-E-E without my COn-sE-EnT??!!” (upgrade had defects)
“YAY! I’M ELEVEN NOW, but where is one. Hellooooo, One? ONE?”
“YAY! Now I’m a small fish in a bigger pond! Wait-”
“YAY!” Ten said, jumping with glee. Unlike his rival twenty-three.
“YAY”
“YES! Finally I’m past rank ten!!
“YES! I’ve finally levelled up! Now only 89 levels to go!”
“YOYLECAKE!!”
“Yay I am an greater number now!”
“Yay! I can’t wait to star in Stranger Things!”

“Yay, I’m finally able to bring along my plus one!”
“Yay, I’m now an 11/10 now!”
“Yay, my value just increased and I feel much more powerful!”
“Yay, now I can back to…wait eating peoples skin is 14’s thing… Imma just go burn down Four’s house!”
“Yes! Finally! After all these years… I’ve found my number one!”
“Yes! I’m another number higher! I better not waste it.”
“Yes! Moving on to my next upgrade. Twelve dollars eh? Easy!”
“Yippee! My skin finally grew back! Take that Fourteen!”
“Yo Seven, hop on ranked, I just got the premium pass.”
“You FOOLS! I’ve only reached an ELEVENTH of my power!”
“You aren’t my papa.” (Stranger Things refrence)
“You can call me the PRIME supreme”.
“You could say I’ve elev-ated the “-en” part of ten!”
“You know seven eight nine? Kinda like that, but less funny.”
“You know, it’s really not an upgrade. All numbers are equal.”
“You think I might think more of myself, I don’t.”
“You've heard of Baker's Dozen, now get ready for Baker's Dozen't!”
“Your LV increased! Something something undertale stats”
“Zero!! Unpack your bags!! You’ve been promoted!!”

“this is just 1 upgrade closer to eating skin!”
“we back with another one”
“wow I’m so glad I have been upgraded to eleven that’s so cool!”
“yay!”
“”Wow! I certainly didn’t expect this!”
“…Seven, what do you feel about running a convenience store together?”
“…” This ten is inanimate.
”That’s one small step for 10, one giant leap for number-kind.”
„From being eaten by 7 to sounding like tin to elevenishness!“
„HEY! WHY DID YOU TAKE AWAY MY T? NOW I DONT HAVE A HOUSE ANYMORE! WHILE RAIN? Great. Atleast I have some new friends like v and n but another e? I already had enough with one! Welp… the question should be downgraded instead of upgraded
„Well I guess I’m one step higher in the game!”
…I still don’t think this was worth all the blood rituals.
さて、私は un nombre más grande! 나는 항상 хотел быть qualcuno più grande agus níos fearr. Ich werde vergeet dit nooit 一天一样长 enquanto eu vivo. Thank you.
